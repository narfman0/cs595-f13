EP: DENAI MOORE - THE LAKE|<div style="text-align: justify;">19 year old <b>Denai Moore</b> was born in Jamaica but grew up in Stratford, East London. She's apparently been making music since she was 7 years old, and has already toured alongside <i>Tom Odell</i>, appeared on the <i>Jools Holland</i> show, and her recently released debut EP titled '<b>The Lake</b>' was produced by <i>Ben Drew</i>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The first song on the EP is the title track '<b>The Lake</b>'. It's instantly powerful, with a sombre piano and distant guitar playing whilst Denai demonstrates her wonderfully talented vocals. Her voice almost sounds like its being held back whilst the listener gets sucked in by the melodies, it's like a musical trojan horse.<br/><br/>'<b>Everything</b>' starts off on in a similar vein, with the music being quite stripped back, very much like the approach on the first <i>James Blake </i>record. However things take an unexpected uptake in beat halfway through, with Denai expressing a more positive tone and a fair amount of groove.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Part 2</b>' is the final track on the record, it's a delicate love song flowing from positive to negative and back again, and is sure to thaw the most frozen of hearts and minds. During the course of the EP there's nods towards the likes of <i>Speech Debelle</i>, <i>Feist</i>, the aforementioned <i>James Blake</i>,<i> Cat Power</i> even, but the over-riding thought is of how Denai has her own carefully crafted sound which is built around folk but is heavily influenced by soul.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Whilst her vocal delivery and approach is a clear stand out feature on this EP, there is also a prominence in her song writing ability, with a clear appreciation of timings and space within her songs. 'The Lake' is a brief snapshot of what this talented young woman is capable of and we're certain interested to follow her progress over the time to come. // <a href="http://www.denaimoore.com/" target="_blank"><b>Denai Moore</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
THE UK BLOG SOUND OF 2014|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Music Liberation</b> is once again both pleased and privileged to have taken part in this years <b>UK Blog Sound </b>poll.<br/><br/>This year we are excited to reveal that two of our three chosen artists have made the final list of 16 - <b>Sophie Jamieson</b> and <b>Mt. Wolf</b>.<br/><br/>There are also two acts who we nominated last time out who have made this years one - <b>Marika Hackman</b> and <b>Wolf Alice</b>. Not that we like to blow our own trumpets or anything!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For those of you unaware here's some background on the Blog Sound poll:-</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Blog Sound Poll was first published in 2011. The concept of the poll wasn’t to criticise the established BBC Sound of list, but simply an experiment to see if UK music bloggers could come up with its own list of emerging artists that was more representative of their community and give the artists that were nominated some extra publicity. Indeed the idea was to compliment the BBC list in many ways by providing an alternative to compare and contrast.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The 2011 list contained some interesting alternatives to the BBC list including Mercury Prize winners Alt-J and Bastille who have found huge commercial success in the UK in 2013. The 2012 list was more similar to the BBC list with Haim being the runaway winners, followed closely by Chvrches.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The UK Blog Sound of 2014 poll is the biggest yet with 59 blogs each nominating their 3 favourite emerging artists. It has been retitled to give emphasis to the fact that it is a list created by UK bloggers, although the choices of music can come from around the world. This year however, 14 of the 16 most voted for artists are British.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The winning act and close runners up will be revealed on the 2nd of January in a short list of three.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This list contains a range of artists that have all received strong coverage from UK bloggers over the last year and can therefore be seen to be a good representation of what music bloggers have been enjoying listening to.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The music blogs that took part in the voting were:-</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div class="ecxMsoNormal"

EP: KID KARATE - LIGHTS OUT|<div style="text-align: justify;">Vocalist and guitarist <i>Kevin Breen</i> and drummer <i>Steven Gannon</i> make up <b>Kid Karate</b>, a duo from Dublin who earlier this year released their EP '<b>Lights Out</b>'. Get prepared for big riffs, big drums, big vocals, basically it's just a big slice of rock pie. BIG.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To start let's mention some similar sounding bands to Kid Karate, such as, and in no particular order, - <i>Black Keys</i>, <i>DZ Deathrays</i>, <i>Middle Class Rut</i>, <i>Jack White</i>, <i>Fugazi</i>...I could go on, but I think you'll get the picture. This is loud, unashamedly brash rock music that is built upon monster riffs and driven forward by Gannon's tribal drumming, amongst which all the while your brain gets melted by Kevin Breen's manic vocals. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Two Times</b>', the lead track from the record, is a perfect introduction to the band. You'll be sure to have lyrics such as '<i>I ain't comin' back, you won't hear from me no more!</i>' seared into your brain after just one listen. The music may sound simple yet it's this raw element that makes it so exciting, good rock music should be like this, letting the listener in easily before holding onto them for dear life kicking and screaming!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Other tracks on the EP include the slow burning '<b>Heart</b>', and the groovy as fuck '<b>This City</b>'. The record closes with '<b>You Need Violence</b>', which is perhaps the most different sounding track on the album, featuring a higher tempo and a relentless drive to punish the listener throughout. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Lights Out</b>' is one of the most exhilarating EP's we've come across this year, a record that has a singular desire from <b>Kid Karate</b> to utilise raw passion and determination to celebrate all that is great with rock music. *Much recommended for you rock heads out there! // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kidkaratemusic" target="_blank"><b>Kid Karate</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
EP: VANCE JOY - GOD ONLY LOVES YOU WHEN YOU'RE DANCING|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Vance Joy</b> is an Australian singer songwriter from Melbourne, who later this month releases his latest body of work, an EP titled '<b>God Only Loves You When You're Dancing</b>' which is coming out through <b>Infectious Music</b> on November 25th. He visited the UK for a mini tour last month and will return again before the end of the year with a one-off show at St Stephens Church on December 4th.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having already had airplay on Radio 1 and a critically acclaimed performance at this years SXSW, not to mention the proposed recording of an album for Atlantic next year, it's fair to say this EP is a fair reflection of where Vance Joy is at, as well as where he is going in the future.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Emmylou</b>' is the first track on the EP, a beautiful introduction to the vocal prowess that Joy commands, his voice sounds believable, a striking combination of fragility and confidence. The track builds slowly at first with just a guitar, but gradually more elements are added almost seamlessly before we've almost entered pop territory without even noticing it. '<b>Riptide</b>' is the single of the record, clearly taking reference from folk such as the Lumineers with big heartfelt vocals which are hard to not get taken in by. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Play With Fire</b>' carries on in a similar vain, but it is '<b>Snaggletooth</b>' where we discover a different dimension to the record. Here emphasis is again placed upon both the vocal delivery and lyrics, as well as some gorgeous strings which give the song extra oomph. There's some guitar finger picking action half way through which breaks things up, but it is the appreciation of space within the song which sets it apart from others on the EP and suggests at greater depth possible on a longer record. The album finishes with '<b>From Afar</b>', a romantic song that will touch the majority of us and is a lovely way to finish the EP.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Comparisons with <b>Vance Joy</b> can be drawn with the likes of singer songwriters such as <i>Benjamin Francis Leftwich</i> and <i>Keaton Henson</i>, but you can also pick out the likes of <i>The Lumineers</i> and <i>The National</i> within his work, meaning '<b>God Only Loves You When You're Dancing</b>' is a record that should please many and his is a name we should look out for in the year to come. // <a href="http://vancejoy.com/" target="_blank"><b>Vance Joy</b></a> // <a href="http://www.infectiousmusicuk.com/" target="_blank"><b>Infectious Music</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
NEW MUSIC: DRENGE|<div style="text-align: justify;">One of the more exciting bands to emerge in recent times are <b>Drenge</b>, a sibling duo from Sheffield (Rory and Eoin Loveless), who recently released their debut self titled album on <b>Infectious Music</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Combining grunge and garage rock there is a real swagger to their music which oozes self confidence, and is pure heaven for those of us who are head bangers / foot tappers. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Be sure to check them out live when they are supporting Peace on their UK tour in December! / <a href="http://www.drenge,co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Drenge</b></a> // <a href="http://www.infectiousmusicuk.com/" target="_blank"><b>Infectious Music</b></a></div>||

Now similarly elusive 7-piece Los Porcos are set to release their double A-side “<b>Sunshine/C.F.W</b>.” this September 15 on <b>Caledonia Records</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">With its indie dance beats and 70s guitar jangles, chunky wah wah guitar riffs and light-up dance-floor funk flashbacks: opening track “<b>Sunshine</b>” is a feel-good pop-rocked tune with a catchy chorus of rippling vocals and a heavy sprinkling of classic disco. Meanwhile on the flipside ‘<b>C.F.W.</b>’ (<i>Classically Feminine Woman</i>) with similarly vintage disco funk infused feel, is a smooth, laid back dance pop track underpinned by sunny beats, tastefully vocoded vocals and jangling upbeat funk guitar.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V0FFDzxnNPM/UhN9ZHMaVGI/AAAAAAAAAAg/vyirECZjeMs/s1600/image001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="209" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V0FFDzxnNPM/UhN9ZHMaVGI/AAAAAAAAAAg/vyirECZjeMs/s320/image001.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>Dancing in the sunshine, Los Porcos mixes up everything that’s good about its members’ musical make up. Despite Soundcloud declaring they come from “<i>New Pork City</i>” the line-up is actually made of seven London and Manchester natives and members of <i>Profundo</i> and <i>FAMY </i>as well as the now defunct Wu Lyf, each bringing their own sound to the fore. Los Porcos’ seamlessly combines the cloudy dream popped melodies of FAMY with the weighty psych-rock riffs of Wu Lyf but with a completely fresh nu-disco funk twist.

ALBUM: MAYORS OF MIYAZAKI - HOLY COP|<div style="text-align: justify;">Brat punk. The exuberance of youth pouring out of every jutting note and shouty verse. Adolescence is both a celebrated freedom and an angst-ridden cross to bear for those in this genre. They’re young, they’re twee, they’re happy. They’re sad, they’re hurt, they’re self-harmy. Such personal turmoil is expressed in an oddly uniform way across the genre considering it comprises of people seemingly angry about conformity and the need for self expression. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Mostly, it’s dual vocals that yap and protest whilst angular guitars jab out math riffs that burst into poppy digressions now and again. Here’s a twisted guitar riff that <i>Battles</i> would be proud of. Here’s a sing along chorus that <i>Johnny Foreigner</i> would love. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here’s an album by <b>Mayors of Miyazaki</b> called <b>Holy Cop</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You can’t help but feel this brat punk, angular, indie rock genre has sailed, disappeared over the horizon, hit an iceberg and is coming back to us in dribs and drabs as flotsam and jetsam. Yet it’s not Mayors of Miyazaki’s fault they’re struggling to stay afloat on an ex-boat. Or genre. Or something. “<i>I didn’t ask to be born!</i>” they might exclaim, before eating their dinner in their bedroom, rather than at the dining table with the rest of the family. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You see, this music has been done and then done some more. The yearning, burning, churning of urgent, angular notes and jerky vocals, the endless switching between the purposely obtuse and the accessibly pop. The duel vocal shrill, the 7/8 time signature, <i>The Automatic</i>, <i>Dananananaykroyd</i>; whatever. Dynastically, this record is a carbon copy of the genre’s forefathers. A predictable romp at best. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Holy Cop</b> conjures up the summer nights of youth, the burn of teenage love and the unrepentant loyalty of your equally youthful friends. It’s all painted here in broad strokes. Broad indeed, as chopping up this album into individual tracks is a baffling challenge. It’s a giant, continuous smear of meandering notes, staccato rhythms and shouty choruses.Saying that, the celebratory jangle of ‘<b>Tongues</b>’ is more poppy and enjoyable than most, whilst the <i>Sleigh Bells</i> style ‘<b>Human Resources</b>’ is a mouth-wateringly jagged and turbulent ride. The wonderful head nodding and groovy riff on ‘<b>Parts per Million</b>’ is stand out, whilst ‘<b>Dry Palm</b>’ has reverberations of 80s post punk pop and the monstrous ‘<b>Muy Sexo</b>’ is a stomping, awesomely swollen riff that could be in any number of gangster movies. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This album seems, at first glance, uninspiring if only for its formulaic predictability. It appears dated and oddly naive. There are moments that, probably in their bid to be different, sound like everything from the last decade. The closing track is guilty as charged, for example. But in this haystack of fiddly guitarisms and half riffs, of barking, spluttered vocal lines and a million drum fills, is a charm, an identity, a odd idiosyncratic quirk that draws you in. The naivety becomes welcoming, a permission to let go of pretension, an instruction to just fucking enjoy yourself. Ok, so Holy Cop isn’t all good but it isn’t all bad either. Its weaknesses are perversely its strengths. It’s hedonistic goofiness turned up to 11. And that alone, is worth checking out. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><b><a href="http://mayorsofmiyazaki.bandcamp.com/album/holy-cop" target="_blank">Holy Cop</a></b> is out now. // <b><a href="http://www.mayorsofmiyazaki.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Mayors Of Miyazaki</a></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div>||
EP: SOPHIE JAMIESON - WHERE|<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FsTap9gfdDo/UgFmfzkpb5I/AAAAAAAAEy8/TnGng0KLsTs/s1600/971782_536302166410990_778626003_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="258" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FsTap9gfdDo/UgFmfzkpb5I/AAAAAAAAEy8/TnGng0KLsTs/s320/971782_536302166410990_778626003_n.jpg" width="320"/></a>'<b>Where</b>' is the softly spoken debut EP from <b>Sophie Jamieson</b> which was released through <b>Folkroom Records </b>at the end of June.<br/><br/>Having recently played a series of live shows including the <i>To Kill a King</i> stage at London's quickest growing, not for profit event <i>Leefest</i>, this Cambridge educated folk musician has gained nods of approval from across blogging networks and the online music scene, as well as featuring on radio stations across London, including independent music lovers <i>BBC 6 Music</i>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Along with <i>Ben Walker</i> (electric guitar, bass, programming), <i>Derek Yau </i>(cello) and <i>Liam Hoflay</i> (electric guitar) Jamieson's music fills shady silences with pensive waves of stillness. She makes gently breathing melodies with soft instrumentation, lifted with cello and electronic nuances, while her vocals lift and fall from heady breaths to strong expressive, full bodied notes. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOVns5yNFJo/UgFTD1S8a_I/AAAAAAAAEys/GC-UrwN3F1E/s1600/a1647355723_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOVns5yNFJo/UgFTD1S8a_I/AAAAAAAAEys/GC-UrwN3F1E/s320/a1647355723_2.jpg" width="320"/></a>Opening and stand-out track '<b>Waterloo</b>' sends silent shocks of melody through the '<i>crowds of waterloo</i>' repeating the refrain and EP title questioning '<i>where are we going to</i>?' Finger style guitar and sustained cello with subtle electronic instrumentation add body to this pensive sound. In '<b>Dinah</b>' Jamieson's acoustic guitar riffs stand out on this soulfully soft and introspective folksy tune  with delicate melodies harmonising with classical touches in the instrumentation. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>I Don't</b>' has the added drama of deep resonating drum beats and fervid cello vibrato that add to the melodic shifts and lulls. '<b>Ode to the East</b>' is hymn-like in contrast and reminiscent of the quieter moments of <i>The Cranberries</i>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Folk is always in danger of falling through the cracks of dull repetitiveness, but there is just enough emotional and instrumental tension within this EP to keep a dreaming listener entranced. This is music like flickering candlelight, to lie still, to think and to feel to.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sophiejamiesonmusic" target="_blank"><b>Sophie Jamieson</b></a> // <a href="http://www.folkroomrecords.bandcamp.com/album/where-ep" target="_blank"><b>'Where' EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.folkroomrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Folkroom Records</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F96389359" width="100%"></iframe></div>||
SINGLE: GINA CIMMELLI - CLEMENTINE|<div style="text-align: justify;">Every so often I become fairly disillusioned with the acoustic singer songwriter genre. Personally I like my acoustic music to be just that, acoustic. Stripped back, mainly letting the guitar, vocals, and lyrics do their thing. Unfortunately there seems to be an increasingly common approach for acoustic artists to quickly shun their rawer roots in favour of a bigger, more in your face production that leans more to pop music than it does acoustic. (<i>Gabrielle Aplin</i> is an example - for me her early work far outshines the debut record which the masses have so far gobbled up this year but left me fairly disappointed).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Which today leads us to <b>Gina Cimmelli</b>, a Brookyln based singer songwriter who oozes talent, confindence, and a clear appreication of how powerful her gentle, yet alluring music can be. '<b>Clementine</b>' is the first of three tracks which will make up her latest EP which is due to be released this Summer.<br/><br/>The track has a beautiful arrangement throughout, with Cimmelli's vocals a clear standout - her voice is tantalizingly fragile yet assured, and overall the track has lovely warm feeling. Imagine a slowed down Best Coast crossed with First Aid it and The Staves and you're getting somewhere close. Keep your ears out for the next single 'Like I Did', which we can tell you is equally fantastic!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://ginaspictureshow.com/" target="_blank"><b>GINA CIMMELLI</b></a></div>||
NEW MUSIC: SNAKADAKTAL - HUNG ON TIGHT|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KTm-ENbyWEA/UerQwy_wY7I/AAAAAAAAEyE/IC9gjqUVuyI/s1600/543864_595965923765366_1400384306_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KTm-ENbyWEA/UerQwy_wY7I/AAAAAAAAEyE/IC9gjqUVuyI/s200/543864_595965923765366_1400384306_n.jpg" width="200"/></a></div>Melbourne 5 piece <b>Snakadaktal</b> have released the video for the first single taken from their debut album '<b>Sleep In The Water</b>', which is released through Australian label <b>Liberation Music</b> (<i>ED: Got to support those guys right with a name like that?!</i>) on the 5th August. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The track '<b>Hung On Tight</b>' is available digitally right now and you can check out the Tooth &amp; Claw directed video below.

VIDEO: MARIKA HACKMAN - BATH IS BLACK|<div style="text-align: justify;">We wrote about <b>Marika Hackman</b> earlier in the year (<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2013/01/single-marika-hackman-bath-is-black.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>) when a succession of acoustic videos were released showing her playing songs from her debut mini album '<b>That Iron Taste</b>' (produced by <i>Alt J's Charlie Andrew</i>) .

SINGLE: DANIEL JAMES - THE STONE AND THE HOLLOW|<div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>The Stone and The Hollow</b>' is the new track from London based singer songwriter <b>Daniel James</b>. It follows the release of his debut track '<b>Jackdraw</b>' earlier in the year. Daniel, who is from Northern Ireland, said about the track that "<i>it was inspired by memories of  walks around Belfast Lough and how that felt different to the new London landscape I found myself in. Time to think and ponder on new and old relationships alike, all compounded by the differing sense of space I felt.</i>"</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The track is sparse, with James singing around a simple beat, piano loop, and acoustic guitar, but this only helps to shine the focus upon his vocals and lyrics which are the clear stand out. His voice is definitive and carries a poignancy that enforces the themes behind his words. Think a more sprightly<i> James Blake</i> cross between a slightly more downbeat <i>Benjamin Francis Leftwich</i>, cut across <i>Alt-J</i> beats. One to certainly look out for this year.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thisisdanieljames.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><b>Daniel James</b></a> // <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ThisisdanielJames" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a> // <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdanieljames" target="_blank"><b>Twitter</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b> </b><span class="ecxApple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><br/></span></div>||
ALBUM: LORE CITY - ABSENCE & TIME|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lore City</b> are not the kind of band to take things lightly. Their dark and emotive music absorbs and revels in all that is melancholic and tumultuous in life. Their music is a giant lament to the bittersweet nature of existence. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Their debut album ‘<b>Absence and Time</b>’ isn't the kind of catchy record to sling on the stereo whilst cooking dinner, it’s a painful work of love and demands attention. It’s not a dip in and dip out record, it’s an all or nothing affair and somehow, Lore City convey all this with half an opening track. ‘<b>Keep</b>’ is the kind of epic sorrow that commands respect; like the <i>Smiths ‘How Soon Is Now’</i> or any other great, atmospheric song about how it hurts to live. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Yet, this is no emo album. This isn't about high school popularity, body confidence or haircuts. <b>Laura Mariposaʼs</b> vocal acrobatics puts paid to that idea. At times she is soft and nurturing, at others slurry and drunk with woe, like a well meaning but ultimately unfit mother. Sometimes, like  on the psychedelic tipped ‘<b>Whole Lot</b>’, she is positively psychotic, a screaming banshee, yelling along to a singular reverb soaked guitar. Like <i>Zola Jesus</i> or a latter day <i>Grace Slick</i>, she is profound in her declaration to the world. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e-vJTtTvMOI/UW8HVkspEsI/AAAAAAAAEtk/rzhVCmw962o/s1600/658008886-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e-vJTtTvMOI/UW8HVkspEsI/AAAAAAAAEtk/rzhVCmw962o/s320/658008886-1.jpg" width="320"/></a>Of course, musician and artistic partner in the band <b>Eric Bessel</b> must also take equal credit and blame for this heady creation. Looking a bit like a bespectacled lawyer or promising, number crunching prodigy in an accountancy firm, he confounds expectations by skilfully creating ominous soundscapes for Mariposa to play with and manipulate. Moaning guitars, elongated, rumbling bass lines and warm, atmospheric hums all wallpaper a backdrop of night time deserts, outstretched roads and the kind of creeping skin touch of reality that only comes in the depths of the night. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All this might sound ludicrously pretentious, but Lore City aren’t here to entertain, they’re here for your soul. Simplicity is their forte. With droll, plodding drum lines <i>Meg White</i> would scoff at, the shimmering loop of a single guitar strum, the wail of a lonely, anguished vocal and the empty chasms of time between beats all strike their own, resonating chord. Closing track ‘<b>Fortuneless Fortune</b>’ displays all these traits with the kind of idiosyncratic flare that it’s only taken a mere eight tracks to fall in love with. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This album is an esoteric, existential and enlightened work of art that operates on a different plain to its contemporaries - if it has any. Truly great from opening bass drum kick to closing guitar strum. Hold on in there, it’s going to get bumpy. // <b><a href="http://www.lorecitymusic.com/" target="_blank">Lore City</a></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
EP: LONDON GRAMMAR - METAL & DUST|<div style="text-align: justify;">So far not much is known about <b>London Grammar</b>, apart from them being a 3-piece (<i>Hannah</i>, <i>Daniel</i>, and <i>Dot</i>), and that their debut release, a 4 track EP titled '<b>Metal &amp; Dust</b>' is out right now digitally and on 7".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our attention was first drawn to the track '<b>Hey Now</b>', a quiet, dark song that gently simmers along almost unnoticed but easily catches you off guard during its relatively short length of 3.27. The vocals are clearly the first point of notice, with Hannah's depth and range standing out, but the electronic based music behind is also interesting, with the use of space, tempo, ambiance, and repetition quite alluring. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Title track '<b>Metal &amp; Dust</b>' is more up tempo, with the beats turned up front and centre, whilst '<b>Darling Are You Gonna Leave Me</b>' has a gentle, party feel to it, with certain parts a bit reminiscent of <i>Ellie Goulding</i> from her debut record. The EP ends with a <i>Dot Major</i> remix of 'Hey Now' which only goes to further strengthen the effectiveness of the track and EP as a whole.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There's plenty of reference points on this EP, with the likes of <i>The XX</i>, <i>James Blake</i>, <i>Egyptian Hip-Hop</i>, <i>Alt-J</i>, <i>Mt Wolf</i> and other ethereal electronic pop artists that seem to surround the airwaves at the minute all being picked up on, but there's also enough ideas and invention to suggest London Grammar have a clear voice of their own. We hear a debut album is in the pipeline and by accounts could be something rather special if this EP is anything to go.<br/><br/>Buy the Metal &amp; Dust' EP from <a href="http://smarturl.it/metalanddust" target="_blank"><b>iTunes</b></a> or the <a href="http://www.normanrecords.com/records/138902-london-grammar--metal-" target="_blank"><b>7"</b></a> now. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/londongrammar" target="_blank"><b>London Grammar</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
EP REVIEW: ANNIE DRESSNER - EAST TWENTIES|<div style="text-align: justify;">Whilst the slew of twee female singer-songwriters continues to be ever present in our mailbag, it does mean that finding those needles in the hack-stack has become quite a joy. The latest sharp point to stand out is American <b>Annie Dressner</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">She's from New York City but moved to the UK last year, which was presumably not for our weather. In 2011 she released her debut album '<i>Strangers Who Knew Each Other's Names</i>', and has played numerous live venues both in New York, and across the UK since her move here. April 8th sees the release of her latest body of work, an EP titled '<b>East Twenties</b>', which is co produced with <i>Paul Goodwin</i>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The EP begins with '<b>Heartbreaker</b>', a song which lyrically deals with that well trodden sad subject, yet musically things are joyously upbeat, with warm sounding guitars and percussion, quite a lovely juxtaposition. Her vocal delivery throughout the record is almost conversational, allowing you to feel a sense of easy understanding and knowing of her songs. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>I Can't Forget</b>' is a touching song that delicately deals with the feeling of loss, with the sincerity of Dressner's vocals shining as well as a beautiful cello emanating throughout. '<b>Flame</b>' is the shortest track on the record at just over two and a half minutes, yet is feels the most full bodied of the songs put forward. '<b>Lost In A Car</b>' closes things out in poignant fashion, dealing with more of life's troublesome issues, with Dressner's soft voice and delicate guitar proving hard to not get swept up by.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>East Twenties</b>' is a record which makes you consider those events which have gone before you, taking you on a somewhat nostalgic journey through feelings which are most probably negative and upsetting. Yet the way in which <b>Annie Dressner </b>presents these four songs is refreshing, with her approachable style and musically upbeat nature leaves you with a positive feeling in the end.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You can pre-order 'East Twenties through Annie's <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/anniedressner" target="_blank"><b>Pledge Music</b></a> page and catch her at the EP launch on the 9th April at <a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/pulluptheroots/event/200739" target="_blank"><b>Slaughtered Lamb</b></a> in London. // <a href="http://www.anniedressner.com/" target="_blank"><b>Annie Dressner</b></a></div>||
EP REVIEW: MT. WOLF - HYPOLIGHT|<div style="text-align: justify;">London four-piece <b>Mt Wolf </b>will be no stranger to those who frequent the music blogging world on a consistent basis, with their EP from last year '<b>Life Size Ghosts</b>' featuring favourably on many sites across the board. Our friends over at <b><a href="http://www.fadedglamour.co.uk/" target="_blank"><i>Faded Glamour</i></a></b> said that "<span class="text_exposed_show"><i>the band have recently been compared to the now Mercury Music Prize winning Alt-J - (and) it's perfectly conceivable that Mt. Wolf will reach such equally great heights.</i>" </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text_exposed_show">High praise and expectation then for a band who only came together at the start of 2012, which is only heightened when names such as <i>James Blake</i>, <i>Sigur Ros</i>, and <i>The XX</i> are thrown in by others as similar acts. But upon listening to their new EP '<b>Hypolight</b>' it's actually quite easy to see where all the hype and fuss is justifiably from. Describing themselves as '<i>dream folk</i>' on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MtWolfOfficial" target="_blank"><b>facebook</b></a>, it's instantly clear that the rather ambiguous new fangled genre is probably about right for them. Beginning with the title track '<b>Hypolight</b>' we have the floaty acoustic guitars intertwined with electronic synths, before the star of the show/ep/album/record steps up the mic in the form of vocalist <b>Kate Sproule</b>. With a voice that seemingly has a multitude of ranges, she controls everything almost effortlessly, which seemingly does put you in a dream like state, so its '<i>dream folk</i>' then, obviously. </span><br/><br/><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HvEIAUtbCNs/UVDOGo4Dj-I/AAAAAAAAEsk/B8jJPSE_cME/s1600/ImageProxy.mvc.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HvEIAUtbCNs/UVDOGo4Dj-I/AAAAAAAAEsk/B8jJPSE_cME/s320/ImageProxy.mvc.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><span class="text_exposed_show">'<b>Veins</b>' carries on in a similar style, the music sounding like it's being stretched like a time lapse video, with Sproule again leading things with her powerful vocals. This time around the music has bit more leadtime, with the <i>Alt-J</i> references becoming more apparent as the guitar/electronic combination is played out well, with that feeling of genres clashing against and then with each other hard to ignore. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text_exposed_show">Lead single '<b>Shapeshift</b>' is perhaps the most complete song on the record, featuring a glorious throbbing beat throughout over which Sproule again impresses with her great depth, with the delicate yet commanding vocals leaving a lasting impression. The accompanying <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIkWI3PsESI&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank"><b>video</b></a> is also worth a look with the simple black and white shots and slow motion effects working to great effect. The EP closes with a cover of <i>Usher's</i> '<b>Climax</b>', which is a more stripped backed approach, which only goes to further enhance the vocal delights of that lady again (<b>Kate Sproule</b> if you didn't know), who has such temperament with her voice it's quite astonishing. She can effect a range of feelings with only the slightest of changes, which you can hardly pick up on during the songs its all done so naturally and seamlessly. </span><br/><br/><span class="text_exposed_show"><b>Hypolight</b> is a strong, dominant record that suggests greater things are indeed ahead for this young four-piece from London. We will certainly watch and listen to their development with keen interest over the time to come.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text_exposed_show"><b>Hypolight</b> is available through <a href="http://twosistersrecords.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Two Sisters Records</b></a> on April 8th. <a href="http://www.mtwolf.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Mt.

NEW MUSIC: BLOODY MAMMALS - MADAM|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bloody Mammals</b> are a post hardcore 4 piece from London, who in May will release their debut mini-album '<b>Eventually Your House Will Burn Down</b>' through <b>49s Vs Dolphins</b> and <b>Flatpack Recordings</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Taken from said album is '<b>Madam</b>', a frenetic two and a half minutes of controlled mayhem - you could think <i>Comeback Kid</i>, <i>La Dispute</i> and <i>Touche Amore</i>, but with a quintessentially British vibe emanating throughout. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It's refreshing to hear such aptitude for their craft from a band this side of the pond - it's fair to say we are expecting big things from the mini record when that drops later this year! </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Pre-order '<b>Eventually Your Horse Will Burn</b>' through <a href="http://bloodymammals.bandcamp.com/album/eventually-your-house-will-burn-down" target="_blank"><b>Bandcamp</b></a> // <a href="http://bloodymammals.com/" target="_blank"><b>Bloody Mammals</b></a></div>||

ALBUM: FIDLAR - FIDLAR|<div style="text-align: justify;">Let’s get this out of the way first: <b>Fidlar's</b> name is an acronym for '<i>Fuck It Dog, Life's a Risk</i>’. Make of that what you will, but it’s certainly a good indicator of the band’s eccentric fratboy approach to their craft. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Chaotic self-titled debut '<b>FIDLAR</b>' is one long ode to partying and over consumption. This unique brand of scrappy surf-punk noise makes them sound like the raucous younger siblings of <i>The Vaccines</i> or a very drunk <i>Japandroids</i>; but these guys aren’t nostalgic about the times they've had, they’re living them, right here, right now and you’re going to hear about it whether you want to or not.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">“<i>I DRINK CHEAP BEER SO WHAT FUCK YOU</i>” bellows the chorus of opening track and lead single ‘<b>Cheap Beer</b>’. ‘<i>There’s nothing wrong living like this, all my friends are pieces of shit</i>’ they declare on ‘<b>Stoked and Broke</b>’. Only two songs in and the band have already firmly nailed their colours to the mast of over indulgence and self destruction.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Whilst FIDLAR pull no punches in who they are and what they do, they’re representing a lifestyle that is nothing new. In fact the <i>live fast die young</i> attitude is a monstrous cliche that most discerning new bands try to avoid. Yet there is a certain gleeful stupidity to this LA foursome’s reckless abandon. They fly in the face of the bookish introspection of today’s indie rock. Each song is an unpretentious slice of shouty power punk that exists for the sake of existing. There’s no deeper meaning other than a hat-tip to the joys of excess.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>FIDLAR’s</b> debut is a simple and surprisingly catchy record that becomes more than the sum of its individual songs by unwittingly representing a sense of fun that has been all but weeded out of new guitar music today. And for that alone, this record is well worth a listen. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It is out now through <a href="http://www.momandpoprecords.com/" target="_blank"><b>Mom and Pop Records</b></a> // <b><a href="http://www.fidlarmusic.com/" target="_blank">Fidlar</a></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
INTERVIEW: VOICES|<div style="text-align: justify;">Another of the acts we recently nominated for the <b>Glastonbury Emerging Talent</b> stage (alongside <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/interview-esper-scout.html" target="_blank"><i><b>Esper Scout</b></i></a> and <b>Moats</b>) were <b>Voices</b>. The melodic post-hardcore band from Hertfordshire were kind enough to answer some of our probing, and some of our not so probing, interview questions.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">To view the full long-list of 120 acts that made it through to the next stage of the competition, as well as all the blogs that took part in the voting process, head over <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/news/2013-emerging-talent-competition-longlist-announced" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Q1. Congratulations on getting through to the next stage of the Glastonbury Emerging Talent stage! What made you apply for this competition? How do you feel about making it through? </b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Even though we're not necessarily suited to the normal Glastonbury scene of bands we will hopefully be trying to bring something new and different to the table, it'll be interesting to find out the response to our tracks and therefore we're incredibly happy that we managed to get through to the long-list, its a great opportunity and a brilliant competition." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Q2. Where are you guys from? How did you meet? </b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"We are from St. Albans, Hertfordshire, homes of bands such as<i> Enter Shikari</i>, <i>Your Demise</i> and <i>Friendly Fires</i>. We met through secondary school and decided to make a band, and from then on we passed through phases of death metal in which we wrote about the devil and the ascension of a demon from hell, to writing post-hardcore style music, which allowed us to wrote more heartfelt music. We have been together for five years now and despite changes in our line up we have carried on strong." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Q3. Describe your music in three words? </b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Dissonant, melodic, meaningful." </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Q4. Who are your musical and non-musical influences? </b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Between us we're pretty heavily influenced by <i>Every Time I Die</i>, <i>Bring Me The Horizon</i>, <i>Letlive</i>, and <i>La Dispute</i>. There are also lots of electronica/atmospheric elements too! Non-musical influences are pretty broad; we like to think we have something to say in our music so in that sense we're interested in exploring certain elements of the world we live in...or think we live in. *init*" </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-igZQT2NDvjo/UTUKmtGnf2I/AAAAAAAAEq0/4MrEmE1UEnk/s1600/479696_527427720624459_523843705_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="319" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-igZQT2NDvjo/UTUKmtGnf2I/AAAAAAAAEq0/4MrEmE1UEnk/s320/479696_527427720624459_523843705_n.jpg" width="320"/></a><b>Q5.

Also, if you haven't heard of them already I'd recommend checking out both <i>CityLightThief</i> and <i>La Dispute</i>.

If you could tour with any two artists, past or present, who would they be and why?</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"<i>At The Drive In</i> and <i>The Cat Empire</i>!

ALBUM: TORRES - TORRES|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gc0iWKRyNc/USKkpCp16jI/AAAAAAAAEas/8pcdSf3CQD4/s1600/155928_136452936506762_2042860661_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gc0iWKRyNc/USKkpCp16jI/AAAAAAAAEas/8pcdSf3CQD4/s320/155928_136452936506762_2042860661_n.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><i>Mackenzie Scott</i> is <b>Torres</b>, a young 22 year lady from Nashville, Tennessee, who earlier last month released her debut self titled album. Like most solo singer songwriters she has a story, however hers is somewhat more believable and that only adds an extra dimension to what is a deftly strong opening body of work.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are told that is was during the Christmas of 2011 that Scott was given her first electric guitar - a <i>Gibson 335</i> for you guitar heads out there, which was a present from her family. With it she discovered that her previously acoustic based songs could take on a whole new form, growing into the ten songs which form her debut LP.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Opener '<b>Mother Earth, Father Good</b>' starts with some sombre strings, before a distorted guitar is added alongside Scott's solemn vocals. This rather melancholy beginning might instantly make you feel like there's going to be great depth to this album; well you wouldn't be wrong. As soon as '<b>Honey</b>' kicks in you know how important that discovery of the electric guitar has been, with Scott herself saying "<i>I didn't quite find the sound I was looking for before I started playing electric</i>".<br/><br/>'Honey' is a 5 minute plus amalgamation of <i>EMA</i> like vocals set against some gorgeous guitar work and knowing drums. The lyrics suit the music poignantly, with the not always perfect guitar and vocal delivery matching up with the content of infatuation, jealousy, and betrayal. It is a theme which is repeated and expanded upon during the course of the album. '<b>Jealousy and I</b>' is purposely sparse, with the lyrics of "<i>Jealousy and I, we're two of a kind, and she's all mine</i>" resonating strongly throughout.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>November Baby</b>' is perhaps the most personal and intimate song on the record, so much so you kind of feel like you shouldn't be listening as it sounds like an entirely private affair for Mackenzie herself. But it's this blatant honesty that makes the song all the more endearing, and with the backdrop of a gorgeous sounding guitar throughout the track is a real standout of the album. It's also over 7 minutes long, allowing for plenty of space for everything to be taken in.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>When Winters Over</b>' is a more straight forward rock track, which is fine, but after the delightfully strong opening you are left feeling a little flat. Thankfully '<b>Chains</b>' takes on a different edge entirely, led by an eerie drum machine, Scott's vocals are given full license to roam, and roam they do throughout, with her deep tones penetrating the icy sound scape which is created. It's haunting, truly brilliant stuff.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VuDmgM3CQ2Y/USKl_4b-III/AAAAAAAAEa8/Tt3wcaUqyDk/s1600/539745_157404721078250_1235360794_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VuDmgM3CQ2Y/USKl_4b-III/AAAAAAAAEa8/Tt3wcaUqyDk/s320/539745_157404721078250_1235360794_n.jpg" width="213"/></a></div>'<b>Moon and Back</b>' is more of the standard rock stuff, perfectly formed but...yeah. '<b>Don't Run Away Emilie</b>' brings us back to the good stuff, as does '<b>Come To Terms</b>', with both tracks stripped back nature a clear staple for success; letting the vocal/guitar combination stand out and just be lovely. The record finishes with '<b>Waterfall</b>', which is a completely satisfying closing track, featuring soft hooks aplenty, warm ambient bass, and a positive vibe which is at odds with all of what has gone before, obviously.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Captured almost straight to tape '<b>Torres</b>' is an album of often simple and sparse arrangements, something which is incredibly brave for someone of Scott's tender years to bare her thoughts and ideas on such an open platform. It's quite a personal record from start to finish, which when combined with her fairly rangy vocals and retro sounding electric guitar (which is pretty much lush throughout), ultimately leads to a debut album which is bold, authentic, and full of integrity - quite frankly its utterly brilliant.<br/><br/>You can download '<b>Torres</b>' now, or buy the physical version on CD or Vinyl later this month - <a href="http://torrestorrestorres.com/MUSIC" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.<br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: FALL CITY FALL - VICTUS|<div style="text-align: justify;">The fine lines between hardcore punk, post hardcore and metalcore have been obscured within the last decade, predominantly thanks to the attempts by pigeonholed bands to free themselves of categorisation. So, you have hardcore bands positioning themselves as DIY punk rock, post hardcore acts aspiring to lose the ‘post’ (in an attempt to dodge association with the emo-end of the post hardcore spectrum), and metalcore bands refusing the crossover tag in a bid to keep the metal-heads onside. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The most positive outcome from all this musical rejigging is the slew of bands that have just embraced all three subgenres, instead of worrying about what they are and aren’t. Canada’s <b>Fall City Fall</b> are one of these bands. Fall City Fall are: hardcore punk, post hardcore and metalcore. Signed to the legendary but largely inconsistent <b>Victory Records</b>, Fall City Fall are an extreme rock band made of five young members, including not one but two vocalists. ‘<b>Victus</b>’ is their Victory debut, and it’s half an hour of intense, penetrating hardcore, laced with occasional melody, intricate time signatures and bruising breakdowns. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Opener ‘<b>St. James</b>’ serves as a short, slow-burning but brutal introduction, before the <i>Every Time I Die</i> influenced ‘<b>Dissentipede</b>’ kicks in with its vocal swagger and frenetic metalcore riffing. The majority of ‘Victus’ follows a similar, winning formula: fast-paced riffing and punk rock drums effortlessly glide into phases of progressive noodlings or post hardcore melody, before or after a <i>Hatebreed</i>-heavy breakdown. Tracks like ‘<b>Anxiety Attack</b>’ and ‘<b>Shallow Believer</b>’ showcase Fall City Fall’s advanced ability to create angry and technical hardcore music, with the latter featuring some hectic <i>Dillinger Escape Plan</i>-esque noise. Only ‘<b>Many Lives</b>’ offers a brief period of calm, but with its haunting prog guitar lines, the instrumental is more eerie than soothing. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p746Yh1NoWU/URfmX_1YjUI/AAAAAAAAEY8/5h1a07X2NFs/s1600/577401_491192477580515_45211604_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p746Yh1NoWU/URfmX_1YjUI/AAAAAAAAEY8/5h1a07X2NFs/s400/577401_491192477580515_45211604_n.jpg" width="400"/></a>The record highlights come in the form of the impressive closing couplet: ‘<b>Taken</b>’ and ‘<b>Victus</b>’. ‘Taken’ is a slow, controlled moment of chaos, starting with quiet guitars and screamed vocals, progressively getting heavier and fuller, with an escalating, piercing siren sound adding menace in the background. Think a mini version of <i>Converge’s</i> title track from ‘<i>Jane Doe</i>’. The closing title track is an amalgamation of soaring post hardcore and crashing breakdowns, with pained screams and moments of guitar melody, reminiscent of <i>The Bled</i> circa ‘<i>Pass The Flask</i>’. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The dual vocals of <b>Zorn</b> and <b>Pylychaty </b>are visceral and oddly complementary. The low-end growls are heavier than most hardcore vocal performances, while the screamed segments carry a bit of <i>Frank Carter’s</i> impassioned cries during his time fronting <i>Gallows</i> – the sound of unrestrained violence, conveyed all the more convincingly because you can comprehend the lyrics through the noise. Intermittent moments of pained vocal melody come in the form of the now commonplace off-key whine (à la <i>Daryl Palumbo</i>, <i>Keith Buckley,</i> <i>Jason Butler</i>). Fitting, but uninspired. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, Fall City Fall have crafted a near-perfect debut record. Brutal but accessible, it’s crowd-pleasing in their inclusion of headbanging breakdowns, and progressive in their use of innovative mathcore and melody. Personally, I rank ‘Victus’ alongside the modern masterpieces by <i>Converge</i> (‘All We Love We Live Behind’), <i>Letlive.</i> (‘Fake History’) and <i>Vision Of Disorder</i> (‘The Cursed remain Cursed’) for sheer passion, but also for successfully bridging hardcore, post hardcore and metalcore without pretentious mutations of the subgenres’ – um – cores. Absolutely thrilling stuff. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fallcityfall" target="_blank"><b>Fall City Fall</b></a> // <a href="http://www.victoryrecords.com/" target="_blank"><b>Victory Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: HANDBOOK - TITANOMACHY|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yFgjwG_06tI/URLbTKg8p_I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/pYoVuzB6MT8/s1600/2647802178-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yFgjwG_06tI/URLbTKg8p_I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/pYoVuzB6MT8/s320/2647802178-1.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Handbook</b> (<i>Jake Brown</i>), all the way from York (the old one not the <i>New</i> one) messes with vintage disco, Motown, soul and hip hop hooks, relentless stuttering cut-off and loops, and just the right beats. '<b>Titanomachy</b>' is an album of danceable yet melodically appealing unadulterated remixes; Brown keeps the vintage soul of his samples alive.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It’s the relentless stuttering loop/cut-off effect of catchy hooks that really gets into your bones. Stand outs include '<b>Feet Feet</b>' with an intensely listenable disco-style flute solo (yes - disco flute) that flickers in a loop/cut-off effect over funk beats and bongos. Irresistible too is '<b>If I</b>' with a looped melodic vocal hook – a laid back soul feel with masterfully layered on subtle and solid beats, this is the sort of track that’s hard to switch off. Opening track '<b>All is Not As it Seems</b>'  hits you with afro sized vocal fanfares and light beats in a 70’s Motown mix up – Brown again manages to create a sound that’s  catchy, danceable, laid back and loud.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Those Days</b>' plays with old school rap and deeper beats, whilst '<b>Ultimatum</b>' steps away from disco towards the vintage Brooklyn hip hop feel: tasty funk guitar looped at the front of mix and male vocal and rap at the back. It’s a dreamy funk piece with attitude. Brown takes it down for tracks like '<b>Zero</b>' – a sensitively mixed soul track with funk beats and emotional perceptivity - and the atmospheric and quirky '<b>Neurotic</b>' – with stuttering drops into silence and auto-tune disco vocal.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We hope to catch this guy live soon, but for now head to <a href="http://handbook.bandcamp.com/album/titanomachy" target="_blank"><b>bandcamp</b></a> to check him out and download the album<b>. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Handbookah" target="_blank">Handbook</a></b><br/><b> </b> </div>||
ALBUM : WIHT - THE HARROWING OF THE NORTH|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wphw9q8UnbM/UQbqv-xrvLI/AAAAAAAAETg/Lojph2ytqhM/s1600/300.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wphw9q8UnbM/UQbqv-xrvLI/AAAAAAAAETg/Lojph2ytqhM/s200/300.jpg" width="200"/></a></div>Stoner rock has always been the territory of the American yee-haw bands. Across the vast Atlantic however, the correlating British scene struggled to compete. We have grey skies and gloomy post-industrial towns, not sun soaked beaches and expansive deserts - our home grown contemporaries were always going to be different to their cowboy hat wearing cousins.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So when the now defunct, Leeds based, post-doom-sludge-whateverists <b>Wiht</b> decided to write an instrumental album about <i>William the Conqueror</i> ravaging the North of England, it was always going to be a distinctly English affair. Their final record, ‘<b>The Harrowing of the North</b>’ is a mere two tracks (plus a lengthy bonus track) but is a veritable epic of stoner rock enormity and post rock exploration. Each twist and turn in this capricious monster, from sparkling single notes, wailing guitars and tinkering cymbals to the gigantic, heavy, fuzzed out riffs and booming drums all serve as analogies for William’s marauding armies across the maudlin North, and events leading up to his remorseful deathbed 20 years later.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wiht might have set themselves a staggering task writing such a record but they manage to convey drama in their music with such aplomb, the entire project is a seemingly effortless success.. ‘The Harrowing...’ is a joy to behold. A swerving, organic beast that you can’t take your ears off, intense and bursting with energy, doom-filled and ominous, it leaves you flabbergasted. This release, in the wake of Wiht’s demise, should be honoured in a fashion akin to the work of any deceased artist of note: with a reverence and awe becoming of a masterpiece, for this record is indeed fitting of such a lofty label. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">‘<b>The Harrowing of the North</b>’ is out 4th February on <a href="http://www.devouterrecords.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank"><b>Devouter Records</b></a>. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wihtleeds?fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Wiht</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
SINGLE: IVORY SEAS - STILL BROODING / MOTHERS TONGUE|<div style="text-align: justify;">Tapping the ambient pop vein, <b>Ivory Seas</b> sew together melodic movement and musical minimalism to create atmospheric tracks ready for the deep icy stills of the British winter. Double A-side with "<b>Mother's Tongue</b>," '<b>Still Brooding</b>' offers a musical chill with a sound truly evocative of the stillness of an icy landscape.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ivory Seas</b>, who met and got together at Southampton University, compare themselves to popular electronic minimalists such as <i>Antlers</i> and <i>The XX</i>. With their catchy stripped back melodies underlaid by cool ambient sound scattered with sparse yet bold instrumentals the comparison seems apt.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Stripping sound back to stillness without losing the upbeat vibe is what Ivory Seas do well. With clever use of instrumental space and silence - '<b>Still Brooding</b>' has ambient sounds rolled over by clever drum beats courtesy of <i>George Batham</i>, sparse undistorted electronic guitar and wintery lyrics that add to the surreal poetics of the track.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Mother's Tongue</b>' makes great use of tubular bell/xylophone and deeply ambient backing vocals (<i>Adam Heron</i> and <i>Thomas Walker</i>) that transforms a standard bass/guitar/drum set up into something festive and melodic yet subtle and surreal, a dark watery sound that skilfully ripples the surface just enough to make you smile. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivoryseas" target="_blank"><b>Ivory Seas</b></a> // <a href="http://ivoryseas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Buy 7" White Vinyl</b></a></div>||

SINGLE: MARIKA HACKMAN - BATH IS BLACK|<div style="text-align: justify;">Ahead of <b>Marika Hackman's</b> debut record in the form of the mini album '<b>That Iron Taste</b>', she recently unveiled an acoustic video for the track '<b>Bath is Black</b>'. It is the first in a series of acoustic videos for each of the albums tracks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The album, produced by Alt-J's <i>Charlie Andrew</i>, is set to be released through <b>Dirty Hit</b> on 25th February, with Marika supporting the release with some gigs with <i>Ethan Johns</i>, as well as her own headline tour in March.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Bath Is Black</b>' is wonderfully refreshing in what can sometimes be a stale folk genre. Starting with some delightful guitar finger picking, its Marika's vocals and poignant lyrics which really stand out here. Her voice has a delicate yet somehow knowing quality which belies her tender years, and you can't help but get drawn into her spell of weaving guitar and floating vocals with the song even changing tempo mid track almost seamlessly. The video itself is shot in an old tunnel somewhere in the North of England, and although simple fits the nature of the track really well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are darker undertones throughout this song, a trait which you can't help feel will be repeated on the forthcoming album. That thought not only builds intrigue ahead of the albums release but also further enhances the reputation of someone who is rather quickly building a steadfast fan-base and critical opinion.  <a href="http://www.marikahackman.com/" target="_blank"><b>Marika Hackman</b></a> // <a href="http://www.dirtyhit.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Dirty Hit</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
FUTURE SOUNDS OF 2013|<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">In last years '<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/future-sounds-of-2012.html" target="_blank"><b>Future Sounds</b></a>' post we tipped <i>Hysterical Injury</i>, <i>Gabrielle Aplin</i>, <i>Daughter</i>, <i>LightGuides</i>, <i>Lucy Rose</i>, and <i>Pale Seas</i>. Most of those acts went on to have a pretty good year, although in the case of Gabrielle Aplin we could never have predicted quite how good! </span><br/><span style="font-size: large;"><br/></span><span style="font-size: large;">This year's list once again features Daughter, not because they didn't have a fantastic 2012, but because their debut album is set to be released this year and we're quite sure it's going to be amazing and propel them onto even bigger and better things, so we're tipping them again!

MUSIC LIBERATION TOP 10 ALBUMS OF 2012|<div style="text-align: justify;">Here's this year's top 10 albums list from <b>Music Liberation</b>. Whilst we didn't quite get to review all of the albums we'd have like to have this year, I feel the records we did get to were all really strong and as a result it was a difficult but wholly enjoyable process of narrowing down the final list you see before you. Hopefully you'll discover something new here you might have missed this year, and at the bottom of the post we also mention those albums we really rated but didn't quite get round to reviewing. 2012 has been a superb year for new music and fortunately for us it only looks like continuing into the new year and beyond. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for reading, listening, and engaging with Music Liberation this year, we'll be back in 2013 slightly fatter, older, and in some cases greyer, but we'll promise to keep up our desire to review and support the best in new music from across the globe. If you'd like to submit your music to us then please head <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/p/contact.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, and if you'd like to join the team and write some reviews then go <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/p/writers.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers! x</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Jon Sidwell (Editor)</b></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"<b>Tall Ships</b> have been on our radar for quite some time now, with us first covering them back in March 2010 with a review of their self titled EP. The trio from Falmouth (now based in Brighton) are signed with the impressive Big Scary Monsters, and Everything Touching is their debut record out as a split release with Blood And Biscuits...<b>Everything Touching</b> is quite possibly one of the best albums you'll hear all year, you just don't know it yet, and for that matter, neither do I, yet. You see this is a complex album which requires several listens to really grasp the depth of ideas this band have put forward over the ten tracks. Some moments are instant, others might take a while longer, but I'm deadly sure that at some point the penny will drop for all...To sum up this album I'll use a vastly overused word - <b>EPIC."</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>"Just listen to the opening couplet of '<b>Attack On Memory</b>' – and you'll barely recognise them. '<b>No Future / No Past</b>' is slow-burning, moody alternative-rock – not a million miles away from Pixies, with grumbling bass and eerie whining building to an exhilarating last minute in which Baldi screams “no future, no past” repeatedly. Darker, angrier, and a damn lot better than anything Baldi has written before. However, the second track '<b>Wasted Days</b>' is not just the best song of their career, it's the best alternative song of the last few months. At nearly 9 minutes, it's much longer than anything else on the album, but it never feels excessively strung-out. Starting off as a simple garage-punk number with a massive vocal hook, it soon gets stuck into a progressive, vocal-less groove, with bubbling sonic textures and climbing, post-hardcore guitars. It’s sprawling, but the climb is never without precision, and the heavy conclusion features Baldi's best ever vocal performance – barking-then-screaming “<i>I thought I would be more that this</i>” over and over with some mighty, mighty passion. It is <i>huge</i>."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"It’s a giant of a record; greater than the sum of its rackety and screeching parts, greater even than the crazy trio that fused it all together in a seaside lab full of smoking, bubbling liquids in glass beakers. The twisting, rich guitar riffs dance around horrendously huge staccato rhythms in some kind of punk / dance insanity that that gives zero fucks to what genre it may or may not fit into, whilst echo-drenched vocals occasionally wail out between the ensuing carnage...Look, whatever, it’s stunning. Words are limited, music is infinite and this is one of the most exciting records in years. It it self indulgent?  Yes. Is it inaccessible? Most probably. Is it genius? No doubt. Think <i>Holy Fuck</i>. Think <i>Sleigh Bells</i>. Think <i>World’s End Girlfriend</i>. Think about every electro-punk-rock crossover that you’ve had the displeasure of hearing and then listen to an entire genre being saved by an epic, breath of fresh air that is this album. Inspired, passionate, adventurous and uncompromising, music really doesn't get much better than this."<br/><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Released earlier this year through Bad Panda Records, 'Tokyo Dreamer' is the new album from 17 year old South Korean Sunik Kim. Going under the moniker of Beat Culture, this exceptionally talented young man is already onto album number two, after releasing his debut LP 'Goldenbacked Weaver' in July of last year when he was just 16.His new record, 'Tokyo Dreamer', is a collection of 10 tracks which demonstrates Beat Culture's impeccable knowledge and skills in electronica...The songs that make up <b>Tokyo Dreamer</b> have a great deal of complexity to them and yet somehow <b>Beat Culture</b> seems to make it all sound so simple, and for any audio fan its literally like food for your ears. Taking inspiration from the likes of <i>Burial</i>, <i>James Blake</i>, <i>Fourtet</i>, and <i>Gold Panda</i>, Beat Culture fuses a range of electronic styles such as dub, hip hop, house, and breaks, to create songs which not only get you moving, put you in a really fucking good mood, but can also transport you wherever you'd like to go."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Dead Wolf Situation is the debut full length album from Bath's Hysterical Injury, a band that should need little introduction to you Music Liberation regulars...My favourite song on the album is '<b>Bitch's Balls</b>' (<i>great title</i>), a track which starts stripped back but is slowly added to with a growing intensity, made up of wild guitars, prominent drums, and far out vocals. Concluding with the monstrous '<b>Rainbow Thunderclap</b>', the '<b>Dead Wolf Situation</b>' experience is one that leaves you feeling part exhausted, part overwhelmed, part enlightened, but in the end wholly satisfied and entirely captivated. As debut albums go its certainly sets the bar high, which will not only challenge those bands around them, but also will surely push the <b>Hysterical Injury</b> onto even greater things in the future. A thought which I hope you'll agree is more than tantalising..."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
Merry Christmas 2012 : First Aid Kit - Blue Christmas|<div style="text-align: justify;">Merry Christmas from all at <b>Music Liberation</b>! Here's <b>First Aid Kit</b> with this years song, their cover of '<b>Blue Christmas</b>'.</div>||
MUSIC LIBERATION - TOP 10 EP'S OF 2012|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Slept And Did Not Sleep</b> is gloriously experimental but still retains a clear melodic and accessible edge. Comparisons could be drawn with the likes of <i>Wu Lyf</i>, <i>Foals</i>, <i>Late Of The Pier</i>, and <i>Everything Everything</i>, but really <b>Ninetails</b> have their own independent sound. You'll pick up different things on each listen of this record making it a real joy for the ears every time. The potential for this band on a full length release is quite tantalising, as is the impact these songs must have on a live audience."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"This debut self titled EP from <b>Wolf Alice</b> has a really strong 'feel good' quality to it, with plenty of summery vibes emanating throughout amongst a lush futuristic far away sound-scape . It's perfect for dipping in and out of as the dreamy folky pop songs carry you whether you'd like to go, almost catching you by surprise at how well put together, thought out, and open they are. It's a tantalizing glimpse at the potential this group clearly has, and we look forward to watching them develop over the time to come."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Salò’s debut EP is certainly a necessary listen for any fans of the bands name-checked in this review. They have struck an ideal position between math-core experimentalism and melodic post-hardcore – all the while clinging onto a straight-up, hardcore-punk-rock essence, and even splicing some garage-y jangle into the guitars."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Samoans</b> are a three-piece from Cardiff in Wales that have been on my personal radar since 2009-ish when I caught them playing the infamous <i>Clwb Ifor Bach</i> in the Welsh capital. Their style of math-rock inspired guitar music caught my attention straight away and I've been following them ever since. It has been somewhat of a wait then until '<b>Elevated Reflections</b>', their debut EP to come out, however the wait has been more than worth it. The music is melodic, heavy in parts, but also tender too, with the standout track being '<b>Catamaran</b>'."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"This simple record is nothing if not brave as Wilson’s self-indulgent approach to music may leave some frustrated. These three solemn songs could struggle for mass appeal as they are cyclical in nature, without the salvation of catchy hooks or crowd pleasing string accompaniments. Yet her basic – almost amateur – approach to writing and recording is her strength. In a genre full of cover songs and faux emotion here we are offered sincerity and truth on a plate with what feels like a healthy disregard for popular expectation. It’s refreshing."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||

For those unaware of this interesting snapshot from the blogosphere here's Robin from the <a href="http://www.breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Breaking More Waves</b></a> blog to explain more.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"The Blog Sound Poll was first published in <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/blog-sound-of-2012.html" target="_blank">2011</a>. The concept of the poll wasn’t to criticise the established BBC Sound of list, but simply an experiment to see if UK music bloggers could come up with its own list of emerging artists that was more representative of their community and give the artists that were nominated some extra publicity. Indeed the idea was to compliment the BBC list in many ways by providing an alternative to compare and contrast.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Last year’s final long list provided some interesting alternatives to the BBC list; most notably it included Alt-J, this year’s Mercury Prize winners, who didn’t feature on the BBC list at all.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Blog Sound of 2013 poll has expanded with 49 UK blogs nominating their 5 favourite emerging artists. Just over 170 acts received at least 1 vote. The winning act received votes from around 25% of all bloggers. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The poll was organised by <i>Robin Seamer</i> (<a href="http://www.breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><i>Breaking More Waves</i></a>) and <i>Andy Von Pip</i> (<a href="http://www.thevpme.com/" target="_blank">The Von Pip Express</a>). Each blog was allowed to vote for five acts and the diversity of the nominations was staggering. Based on the evidence of the spread of votes anyone that says that music bloggers are sheep and are all writing about the same artists has got it wrong. However, the results of the poll show that certain artists do have a lot of support and love from a significant portion of UK bloggers and those artists make up the Blog Sound of 2013 list,”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So here's the results! (We'll be revealing the top 5 and winner of the <b>Blog Sound of 2013</b> on January 3rd, and we'll also let you know who <b>Music Liberation</b> picked in our customary <b>Future Sounds</b> feature, suffice to say that one of our picks has made the long-list, you can probably guess who!) </div>||
NEW MUSIC: MARIKA HACKMAN|<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vv_QxDffovM/ULJ9bZSxvzI/AAAAAAAAD7A/d9o8lAvK0o4/s1600/avatars-000018472088-yrcz0d-crop.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vv_QxDffovM/ULJ9bZSxvzI/AAAAAAAAD7A/d9o8lAvK0o4/s320/avatars-000018472088-yrcz0d-crop.jpg" width="320"/></a><b>Marika Hackman</b> is a twenty-year old from London, who earlier this year released her debut material in the shape of a double a-side single '<b><a href="http://soundcloud.com/marika-hackman/marika-hackman-you-come-down" target="_blank"><i>You Come Down</i></a></b>' and '<a href="http://soundcloud.com/marika-hackman/marika-hackman-mountain-spines" target="_blank"><b><i>Mountain Spines</i></b></a>' through Transgressive offshoot <i>Paradyse Records</i>. She recently supported <i>Benjamin Francis Leftwich</i>, and this week she sets out on her own mini headline tour of the UK. Theres also been a 5-track covers EP which has been floating around for a little while, with acts such as <i>Warpaint</i>, <i>Nirvana</i>, <i>Nico</i>, <i>The Knife</i>, and <i>Dusty Springfield</i> all receiving the 'Hackman treatment'. It's fair to say then that she's been a pretty busy lady of late, and with 2013 just round the corner and mentions of further material appearing soon, she's shows no sign of slowing down. But what of her style? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well it's folk, but not the happy-go-lucky paint-by-numbers stuff, she has much greater resolve, ideas, and complexity to fit into that bracket. Her voice has great depth, and a dark edge which hints at someone who has done her musical homework and absorbed a wide range of different influences and styles. Returning to the aforementioned EP it is not just the calibre of artists that have been covered, but the approach Marika has taken with it that really shines through, as she brazenly implements her stripped back ideas almost completely transforming the songs into her own material. The cover of '<i>Lithium</i>' by <i>Nirvana</i> in particular stands out, but each track has its own charm. Overall it's a striking listening experience and a tantalising glimpse at what our ears could look forward to next year with the release of new material. We're excited...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Check out the covers EP and forthcoming headline tour dates<i><b> &gt;&gt;&gt; </b></i> <a href="http://www.marikahackman.com/" target="_blank"><b>www.marikahackman.com</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Marika-Hackman/113617992037814?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Marika Hackman</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
EP: NINETAILS - SLEPT AND DID NOT SLEEP|<div style="text-align: justify;">Signed to <b>Superstar Destroyer Records </b>(<i>awesome name</i>), Liverpools' <b>Ninetails</b> follow up their debut EP '<i>Ghost Ride The Whip</i>' with their new record '<b>Slept And Did Not Sleep</b>'. Straight off I'll let you know I think it's an incredibly ambitious sounding album that arrives with an ever increasing fanfare from the likes of <i>This Is Fake DIY</i> and <i>Clash Magazine</i>. Having already shared stages with <i>Alt-J</i>, <i>Tall Ships</i>, and <i>Errors</i>, Ninetails have certainly built up a strong reputation already despite their short history together as a band.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The 5-track EP kicks with '<b>Maybe We</b>', a defiant opening of rumbling bass and distant guitars which is slowly transformed into a full on rhythmical beast, featuring soaring guitars and transfixing drums, alongside otherworldly vocals. It's a strong opening which sounds really complete and together showing a band clearly in tune with their ideas and intentions. '<b>Body Clock</b>' follows with offbeat drums, intentionally ambiguous vocals, and yet more gorgeous guitars creating those floating hands in the air, slow motion moments. The ending of the song is drawn out, with the band veering off into experimental territory with sound coming and going with various moments of feedback, synths, and drones. For the second track on the record it's a brave decision to stray off the beaten track so early, but it works ever so well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Fawdon Fever</b>' is next up, a stunningly groove laden track which never ceases to bore, with the intricate and melodic guitars proving hard to not get consumed by. '<b>Boxed In</b>' is an odd track, being almost devoid of any apparent rhythm or melody, leaving us with distant futuristic bleeps and drones which if nothing else certainly puts you on edge and wondering what on earth is going on. At over 8 minutes in length its not a track which will appeal to all, but if you like to hear different ideas within your musical palette then you may well find something here for you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Finishing this EP is '<b>Mama Aniseed</b>', a track which seemingly brings together all the elements which have gone before it. There's the experimental electronic moments, melodic guitars, offbeat drums, as well as the first proper introduction to <b>Ed Black's</b> vocals. For me its the guitars which really suck me in with Ninetails, with the delicate riffs and finger picking complimenting the drums perfectly, leading to those brilliant moments of music which just feel completely right, emphatically suiting whatever mood you're in.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Released on December 10th,<b> Slept And Did Not Sleep</b> is gloriously experimental but still retains a clear melodic and accessible edge. Comparisons could be drawn with the likes of <i>Wu Lyf</i>, <i>Foals</i>, <i>Late Of The Pier</i>, and <i>Everything Everything</i>, but really <b>Ninetails</b> have their own independent sound. You'll pick up different things on each listen of this record making it a real joy for the ears every time. The potential for this band on a full length release is quite tantalising, as is the impact these songs must have on a live audience. Speaking of which the band are playing their first London date at the Bull and Gate on November 29th, alongside the Music Liberation endorsed <i>Crushing Blows</i>. We'll see you there!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://ninetailsband.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Ninetails</b></a> // <a href="http://superstardestroyer.bandcamp.com/album/slept-and-did-not-sleep" target="_blank"><b>Stream/Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.superstardestroyer.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Superstar Destroyer Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
EP: TO KILL A KING - WORD OF MOUTH|<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qXb-MvUf47k/UJwsj6TzRGI/AAAAAAAAD3Y/cNY1NJGlWS8/s1600/391591_502814853079014_1952590182_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qXb-MvUf47k/UJwsj6TzRGI/AAAAAAAAD3Y/cNY1NJGlWS8/s320/391591_502814853079014_1952590182_n.jpg" width="320"/></a>Hailing from London, <b>To Kill A King</b> may seem a little bit cliché on the surface. They formed at university in Leeds, and they wear the '<i>oh so hip</i>' folk-rock-indie-pop label of so many of their peers - it might be easy for this delightful little band to wash over you altogether. Don't let them, there is a lot more ambition evident here than meets the eye, if latest EP '<b>Word of Mouth</b>' is anything to go by.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you heard To Kill A King on the radio, the sharp guitars coupled with <i>Ralph Pelleymounter's</i> croon may evoke a juxtaposition of <i>Editors</i> and <i>Coldplay</i>. However, put this EP through a decent set of headphones on a cold walk home, perhaps thinking of someone special, and it becomes clear that these guys have the potential to go far.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The EP kicks off with '<b>Howling</b>'. Warm, bass filled synth flood the ears - quickly giving way to ambitious multi-instrumentation that will undoubtedly evoke thoughts of <i>The National</i> and delicate vocal harmonies that will pull at the heartstrings. Building to a powerful metallic climax, this really is a great start. Remarkably, To Kill A King ease into top gear on '<b>Funeral</b>', with the intro easily adding shine to any Apple ad, giving way to a tour-de-force in really great song-craft.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Things slow down with '<b>Besides She Said</b>', whereas '<b>Wolves</b>' is a bright, catchy modern indie song with the obligatory anthemic chorus. Momentum builds once again with the brilliant <b>'Rays'</b>, which is rousing indie-pop at it's best, evoking the highlights of big hitters such as <i>Bombay Bicycle Club</i>. Intricate guitars are underpinned with a tight, flexible bass line and a masterful vocal performance from Pelleymounter, ending in a frantic flurry of drums and hi-hat. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Closing track '<b>Let It Die</b>' demonstrates the emotional maturity of the lyrics that run through the heart of this EP. "<i>The saddest part of a broken heart isn't the end so much as the start</i>" will remain with you long after the final chords fade away. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Give me a broken heart any time if it means the start of something this special.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://tokillaking.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>To Kill A King</b></a> // <a href="http://tokillaking.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Buy 'Word Of Mouth' EP</b></a><br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F53087258&amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe></div>||
EP: OLILOQUY - THE RED EP|<div style="text-align: justify;">Next up from London’s <b>Sup Peeps Records</b> comes <b>The Red EP</b>, the first of a ‘<i>Three Colours Trilogy</i>’ from <b>Oliloquy</b> (aka <i>CIRCLE</i>), provider of two of the jazziest, funkiest tunes (and a remix) on the label’s introductory two-disc '<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/album-sup-peeps-start-collecting.html" target="_blank"><b>Start Collecting</b></a>' and coming in at only 6 songs long, I decided I would push the boat out and cover each one.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Due for both physical and digital release on Halloween, those expecting the same laidback, jazz-infused vibe from this EP may be disappointed as there is not a trumpet flare or flute flourish to be found. Bare with me though, it’s still worth a listen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">An ominous, plodding beat sets off intro track ‘<b>Circle’s Theme 1</b>’, building into a gloriously glitch-ridden bass-fest before ‘<b>Borealis</b>’, the EP’s most chilled number, calms things down for a bit. Things get almost cheery on ‘<b>Intelligence</b>’, a good Electronica-inspired track (to my uncouth, Hip Hop-tainted ears, anyway) but it seems a bit too polished which makes it stand out a bit among the murkier EP highlights. The opening of ‘<b>BATS!</b>’ reminded this old drum &amp; bass head of <i>Mampi Swift</i> in his ‘<i>Jaws</i>’ days- never a bad thing. Add a tasty bit of scratching, a familiar-sounding melody that floats in and out and a grimy bassline and the result? A nodding head and thumbs up from me.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">‘<b>Additive</b>’ is a downtempo, almost uneasy listen at first; a droning organ-like sample plus some distorted scratches lead you to think it is another Borealis-esque track. Then the bassline slams in. It is crunchy and chewy and spectacular. I can see this track going down well at whatever the equivalent of a rave is these days (still raves? Someone enlighten me).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rounding off this brief extended player in epic form is ‘<b>Invaders From Wherever</b>’, stuffed full of chest-rattling bass, stirring melodies and non-annoying glitch-synth bits (technical term). I’m sure I heard bongo drums just before that first drop too and you can’t not love a tune that features bongos, right? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So to sum up, this isn’t one for the acoustic folk lovers. If you like your music bassy, glitchy and covered in synths, you should definitely give <b>The Red EP</b> a listen. Do me one favour when you do though- listen to it on a decent set of speakers, eh? Those tinny little things on your laptop will never do this EP justice. Not in a million years.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Circle-AKA-Oliloquy/183931891637597" target="_blank"><b>Oliloquy</b></a> // <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/qid=1349435860/ref=sr_grid_albumrank?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=Oliloquy&amp;index=digital-music&amp;rd=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;search-type=ss&amp;sort=albumrank" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://suppeeps.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sup Peeps Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: CITIZENS - CTZNS|<div style="text-align: justify;">2012 has been a little quiet on the UK hardcore front. There were some excellent releases last year – with <b>Shapes</b>’ ‘<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/album-review-shapes-monotony-chic.html" target="_blank"><i>Monotony Chic</i></a>’ and <b>The Computers</b>’ ‘<i>This Is The Computers</i>’ becoming two of my favourite noisy albums of the last few years. However, nothing has really stood out this year, at least not to this bored reviewer. However, the debut album from Glasgow trio <b>Citizens</b> – titled ‘<b>CTZNS</b>’ – arrived in my inbox this week, and all of a sudden I was bored no longer.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having released two well-received EPs – including the formidable ‘<b>Try Harder</b>’ EP – and built up a rather respectable live reputation, one might have expected Citizens to take their time constructing their first full length. WRONG. ‘<b>CTZNS</b>’ was recorded in a single day, live! Yet, the production quality is remarkably fine, especially considering the erratic and heavy nature of the music. For this we must surely commend the engineer and studio (<i>Bruce Rintoul</i> and <i>Lofi Studio</i>, Glasgow), as well as the impressive tightness of the trio’s instrumentation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Citizens make hectic, progressive hardcore – with experimental time signatures, frantic riffing, emotive and throaty vocals, and punk rock pacing. There are snippets of post hardcore in the more melodic or jangly segments of ‘CTZNS’, such as the first half of ‘<b>Heavy Breather</b>’ (before the punishing, sludgy riff and earthy vocals of the final stretch) or the mid section of the sprawling epic that is closer ‘<b>Distance Blues</b>’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, for the most part, this is aggressive hardcore punk with math-rock noodlings. Take the 49 second track ‘<b>New Punks</b>’, which despite its short, sharp punk structure, still manages to fit in some jumpy off-kilter guitars. Some of <i>Craig McIntyre’s</i> guitar work is thrilling, such as on the instrumental ‘<b>Hats Off To Phil Differ</b>’ and the glorious, slow burning opener ‘<b>Habitual Smoker Blues</b>’. Previous single ‘<b>Try Harder</b>’ (from the EP of the same name) reappears here, and is perhaps the track that best showcases what Citizens are all about – slow, chunky riffs and ear-splitting screams that evolve into stabbing, proggy playfulness, bouncing alongside<i> Owen Batchelor’s</i> grumbling bass, before a heavy riff mean enough to slay and bury an emo kid dominates the rest of the song. It’s all very <i>Pulled Apart By Horses</i> (before they moved into more alt-rock territory). </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The fact that ‘<b>Woollen Mammoth</b>’ is the album highlight is unmistakable. The quick-fire, stop-start riffing and monumental shifts in structure encapsulate all the best trademarks of post hardcore, progressive hardcore, mathcore – hell, it’s HARDCORE to its…core. Citizens are the best new UK (post) (progressive) hardcore outfit to emerge in 2012, hands down. Their music manages to be intelligent yet accessible, and as heavy as a blissful head-butt in a punk rock mosh pit.

ALBUM: SUP PEEPS - START COLLECTING|<div style="text-align: justify;">London based <b>Sup Peeps Records</b> may not be a familiar name for most- it wasn’t to me anyway, but <b>'Start Collecting'</b>, the first compilation from this enigmatic label is a jazzy, funky, hip hop-ified two-disc rollercoaster that is well worth checking out.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you ask me, when the compilation gets its jazz-funk on is when it is at its strongest. Album opener <b>'Asa715'</b> by <b>Four Leaf Sound</b> and '<b>CIRCLE</b>' aka <b>Oliloquy’s</b> two contributions (<b>'I’ll Drive the Band'</b> and <b>'The Subject Is…'</b>) set the bar high and if you don’t find yourself nodding along to '<b>Sepia Sky</b>' by <b>OdjBox</b>, I simply don’t think we could ever be friends.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Disc two starts strong too. There’s something hypnotic about the bells and vocal sample in <b>Trig’s</b> <b>'Kibou no Kiseki (Track of Hope)'</b> and <b>Jill Peacock</b> shows us on '<b>Up in the Air</b>' that she has a pretty awesome voice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A couple of tracks, '<b>Got to Get On Now</b>' by <b>Yuki Kanesaka</b> and '<b>Twist off Cap</b>' by <b>Big Hell</b> feature beats that sound a bit too much like the classic two-step beat of UK Garage for my taste but may conjure nostalgic vibes for those of a similar vintage to me (I was always more of a drum &amp; bass fan myself). They stick out a little among the more laid back tracks but may offer a pleasant change of gears if the jazz gets a bit much for you. The rapper on '<b>Got to Get On Now</b>' will never set the Hip Hop on fire either…</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you’re a fan of UK Hip Hop, look up <b>Boodacon</b>. His performance on DJ Buzzword’s <b>Small Town Pleasures</b> is (and I’m guessing he’ll hate this comparison if he reads this) reminiscent of <i>Mike Skinner</i>… If Mike Skinner knew how to flow ON a beat instead of around it, although he does veer into ‘talking over the beat’ territory. If the original of Hot Donkey’s Disregard is as funky as Ali Jameson’s remix, then I’m looking them up when I finish this review. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All in all, I’d say <b>Stay Collecting</b> is well worth a listen, or even worth dusting off your wallet. If this is a taste of things to come from <b>Sup Peeps</b>, I recommend making a note of the name and the talented bunch that album A&amp;R <i>Jay Kenny</i> got together.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://suppeeps.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sup Peeps Records</b></a> // <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPGcscCIiwk&amp;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank"><b>Album Trailer</b></a> // <a href="http://soundcloud.com/sup-peeps-records/sets/sup-peeps-start-collecting" target="_blank"><b>Stream/Buy 'Start Collecting'</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
ALBUM: TALL SHIPS - EVERYTHING TOUCHING|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tall Ships</b> have been on our radar for quite some time now, with us first covering them back in March 2010 with a review of their <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/ep-review-tall-ships-tall-ships.html" target="_blank"><b>self titled EP</b></a>. The trio from Falmouth (now based in Brighton) are signed with the impressive <b>Big Scary Monsters</b>, and <b>Everything Touching</b> is their debut record out next week on October 8th as a split release with <b>Blood And Biscuits</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The album begins with '<b>T=O</b>', a sumptuous half instrumental <i>Mogwai</i> inspired track which sets the bar ever so high. Vocalist <b>Ric Phethean</b> enters halfway through, but it is the guitars that really shine bright. Launching straight into '<b>Best Ever</b>', the band continue their impressive early <i>Foals-esq</i> mathrock, with once again those guitars really standing out. It's heavy, but also it's not, in a weird way, as the melodic rhythmic nature of the music carries you effortlessly along. Things are slowed a tad for third track '<b>Phosopherence</b>', with Plethean's vocals given more of the limelight. It's a solid track, if nothing spectacular especially after the opening first two tracks. '<b>Oscar</b>' starts in a similar fashion to the previous song, but after a slow start things get ramped up for an emphatic guitars driven ending (<i>ED: yes more guitars!</i>).<br/><br/>'<b>Ode To Ancestors</b>' is simply beautiful, vocally and musically, with the sparseness in the track enhancing everything. Things get moving halfway through and the familiar pattern of group vocals and big guitars takes us through to the end. It builds and builds until you are forced to take notice, but actually it really works well and its a pleasure to let the band take over your mind. The one track I struggle with on this album is '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa4Y8RO590A" target="_blank"><b>Gallop</b></a>', purely because it reminds me of <i>The Vaccines</i>, with the vocals, and the drumming in particular reminding me of that bloody band (<i>ED: let it go Jon, it was a long time ago...</i>). Did I mention that also happens to be the latest single from the record?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Moving swiftly on, '<b>Idolatry</b>' sounds gigantic, with the band somehow creating even more space and variety in their music. During the six minutes of the track heart strings are tugged, heads are rocked, feet are tapped, and your mind will definitely be taken someplace else. It's a different track to others on the album, with the band moving away from their trusted guitar riffs and being more experimental, and it works, really well. An entire album of tracks just like that would go down very well (<i>ED: hint, hint</i>). '<b>Books</b>' is the thinking mans' song, lyrics about time being precious, interspersed with soaring guitars and big drums. Nice. Final track '<b>Murmurations</b>' is an epic nine-minuter, growing from a distance beat and lone guitar into a full on rhythmic monster with keys, guitars, drums, and vocals all combining to leave a song which is just a joy to listen to again and again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Everything Touching</b> is quite possibly one of the best albums you'll hear all year, you just don't know it yet, and for that matter, neither do I, yet. You see this is a complex album which requires several listens to really grasp the depth of ideas this band have put forward over the ten tracks. Some moments are instant, others might take a while longer, but I'm deadly sure that at some point the penny will drop for all, with the album sure to feature in many top 10's come the end of the year. To sum up this album I'll use a vastly overused word - <b>EPIC.</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://tallshipsband.bigcartel.com/product/everything-touching-cd-album" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order/Buy 'Everything Touching</b></a>' // <a href="http://www.wearetallships.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Tall Ships</b></a> // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigscarymonsters?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Big Scary Monsters</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bloodandbiscuits?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Blood And Biscuits</b></a></div>||
ALBUM: NEGATIVE PEGASUS - LOOMING|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2GXf4cBGbM/UF8Hkrzsz-I/AAAAAAAADyM/2VPSniRRZTw/s1600/e1807fa67a59336e4f84c550952597e0efd5a7c2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z2GXf4cBGbM/UF8Hkrzsz-I/AAAAAAAADyM/2VPSniRRZTw/s320/e1807fa67a59336e4f84c550952597e0efd5a7c2.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Negative Pegasus</b>, or “<i>Neg Peg</i>” as fans should, and most probably are, calling them are three mad scientists from Brighton, mixing together the phatest, scariest beats you’ll hear this side of the English channel. And like the Frankensteinian monster it is, debut album ‘<b>Looming</b>’ wanders around, clumsy and aimless, smashing the shit out of anything in its path; mostly, your ears.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It’s a giant of a record; greater than the sum of its rackety and screeching parts, greater even than the crazy trio that fused it all together in a seaside lab full of smoking, bubbling liquids in glass beakers. The twisting, rich guitar riffs dance around horrendously huge staccato rhythms in some kind of punk / dance insanity that that gives zero fucks to what genre it may or may not fit into, whilst echo-drenched vocals occasionally wail out between the ensuing carnage. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Forget hyperbole, this record is genius. Here are some adjectives that are literally being extracted from my head upon listening: Fuck off tonal slabs / Monolithic chunks of analogue blasts / Raw and primal grooves / Rhythmic sucker-punches of distortion / Sonic angularities / Guttural guitar barks / Psychedelic vocal wails / Swaggering stuttery monstrosities / Gargantuan tanks of noise / Red raw strips of vulgar howls / Propulsive instrumentals / Unadulterated guitar riffage / Screaming seas of feedback / Manic explosions of sound / spiky and haunting guitar echos / growling rumbles of square shaped frequencies / ominous and dronal pomposities… </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j6GF1UnUeGY/UF8IrpJW9VI/AAAAAAAADyU/lkse6MdsMss/s1600/7106268641_a7897a986a_z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j6GF1UnUeGY/UF8IrpJW9VI/AAAAAAAADyU/lkse6MdsMss/s200/7106268641_a7897a986a_z.jpg" width="160"/></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Look, whatever, it’s stunning. Words are limited, music is infinite and this is one of the most exciting records in years. It it self indulgent?  Yes. Is it inaccessible? Most probably. Is it genius? No doubt. Think <i>Holy Fuck</i>. Think <i>Sleigh Bells</i>. Think <i>World’s End Girlfriend</i>. Think about every electro-punk-rock crossover that you’ve had the displeasure of hearing and then listen to an entire genre being saved by an epic, breath of fresh air that is this album. Inspired, passionate, adventurous and uncompromising, music really doesn't get much better than this. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The aptly named ‘<b>Looming</b>’ will be released by <b>Small Town America</b>, home of some of the best guitar bands of recent years, on 24th September 2012.

SINGLE: LAURA WELSH - CALL TO ARMS / HOLLOW DRUM|<div style="text-align: justify;">If <b>Laura Welsh</b> turned our heads earlier this year with the introduction of her debut track '<b>Ghosts</b>', then she's making us do cartwheels now with not one but two brand new tracks, '<b>Call To Arms</b>', and '<b>Hollow Drum</b>'.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Both tracks show off her remarkable voice, which really does need to be heard, any words I could write will never do it justice. While the music itself is sparse but perfectly arranged. Little is known about her at this stage, but if the quality of tracks released so far is anything to go by then that won't last for long.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://laurawelsh.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><b>Laura Welsh</b></a> / <a href="http://soundcloud.com/laurawelsh" target="_blank"><b>Soundcloud</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laurawelshofficial" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/_laurawelsh" target="_blank"><b>Twitter</b></a></div>||
EP: CARA MITCHELL - HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED|<div style="text-align: justify;">At just 16 years of age, Scottish lass <b>Cara Mitchell </b>could be forgiven for filling her young mind with many different thoughts, from aspirations for the future, ideas of discovery, or just deciding whether or not it's possible to fit another episode of '<i>Hollyoaks</i>' into a busy night of television viewing (<i>ED: Young people still watch Hollyoaks right?</i>). And whilst she may indeed spend her time contemplating such things, she has also managed to fit into her schedule the writing and recording of her debut EP '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>'.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Released through <b>AGP</b> on September 23rd, the four-track record begins with the title track '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>', a truly simple yet glorious folk song, which introduces Cara's delicate vocals and her obvious ear for space within her music. '<b>Passing Sun</b>' furthers the strength of her infectious vocals, but it is the combination of her excellent hard/soft acoustic guitar which enhances the poignancy of the lyrics she's singing. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSrZtMQ7T6o/UFJI0oPUocI/AAAAAAAADvE/TRe4QuXh5UA/s1600/Cara+Trend+2+(FILEminimizer).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="135" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSrZtMQ7T6o/UFJI0oPUocI/AAAAAAAADvE/TRe4QuXh5UA/s200/Cara+Trend+2+(FILEminimizer).jpg" width="200"/></a> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Next October</b>' shows a greater depth to her voice, which should only get better as she gets older, albeit she might lose that quirky daintiness which comes from being so young. The EP closes with '<b>Little Birdies</b>', another perfectly formed track which introduces yet another style of singing from Cara, which is more jaunty and direct helping to put you in the moment, where if you close your eyes you really could imagine walking through a forest, with the sun shining, and the birds singing. Bliss.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cara Mitchell's</b> debut EP '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>' does more than just show much promise, it actually delivers straight off the bat. Never has the '<i>maturity beyond her years</i>' tag appeared more deservedly on  <b>Music Liberation</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You can catch Cara supporting <i>Esperi</i> during their UK tour during September/October. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CaraMitchellMusic/app_139114646178872" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.caramitchell.net/" target="_blank"><b>Cara Mitchell</b></a></div>||
ALBUM: TORRES - TORRES|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gc0iWKRyNc/USKkpCp16jI/AAAAAAAAEas/8pcdSf3CQD4/s1600/155928_136452936506762_2042860661_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Gc0iWKRyNc/USKkpCp16jI/AAAAAAAAEas/8pcdSf3CQD4/s320/155928_136452936506762_2042860661_n.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><i>Mackenzie Scott</i> is <b>Torres</b>, a young 22 year lady from Nashville, Tennessee, who earlier last month released her debut self titled album. Like most solo singer songwriters she has a story, however hers is somewhat more believable and that only adds an extra dimension to what is a deftly strong opening body of work.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We are told that is was during the Christmas of 2011 that Scott was given her first electric guitar - a <i>Gibson 335</i> for you guitar heads out there, which was a present from her family. With it she discovered that her previously acoustic based songs could take on a whole new form, growing into the ten songs which form her debut LP.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Opener '<b>Mother Earth, Father Good</b>' starts with some sombre strings, before a distorted guitar is added alongside Scott's solemn vocals. This rather melancholy beginning might instantly make you feel like there's going to be great depth to this album; well you wouldn't be wrong. As soon as '<b>Honey</b>' kicks in you know how important that discovery of the electric guitar has been, with Scott herself saying "<i>I didn't quite find the sound I was looking for before I started playing electric</i>".<br/><br/>'Honey' is a 5 minute plus amalgamation of <i>EMA</i> like vocals set against some gorgeous guitar work and knowing drums. The lyrics suit the music poignantly, with the not always perfect guitar and vocal delivery matching up with the content of infatuation, jealousy, and betrayal. It is a theme which is repeated and expanded upon during the course of the album. '<b>Jealousy and I</b>' is purposely sparse, with the lyrics of "<i>Jealousy and I, we're two of a kind, and she's all mine</i>" resonating strongly throughout.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>November Baby</b>' is perhaps the most personal and intimate song on the record, so much so you kind of feel like you shouldn't be listening as it sounds like an entirely private affair for Mackenzie herself. But it's this blatant honesty that makes the song all the more endearing, and with the backdrop of a gorgeous sounding guitar throughout the track is a real standout of the album. It's also over 7 minutes long, allowing for plenty of space for everything to be taken in.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>When Winters Over</b>' is a more straight forward rock track, which is fine, but after the delightfully strong opening you are left feeling a little flat. Thankfully '<b>Chains</b>' takes on a different edge entirely, led by an eerie drum machine, Scott's vocals are given full license to roam, and roam they do throughout, with her deep tones penetrating the icy sound scape which is created. It's haunting, truly brilliant stuff.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VuDmgM3CQ2Y/USKl_4b-III/AAAAAAAAEa8/Tt3wcaUqyDk/s1600/539745_157404721078250_1235360794_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VuDmgM3CQ2Y/USKl_4b-III/AAAAAAAAEa8/Tt3wcaUqyDk/s320/539745_157404721078250_1235360794_n.jpg" width="213"/></a></div>'<b>Moon and Back</b>' is more of the standard rock stuff, perfectly formed but...yeah. '<b>Don't Run Away Emilie</b>' brings us back to the good stuff, as does '<b>Come To Terms</b>', with both tracks stripped back nature a clear staple for success; letting the vocal/guitar combination stand out and just be lovely. The record finishes with '<b>Waterfall</b>', which is a completely satisfying closing track, featuring soft hooks aplenty, warm ambient bass, and a positive vibe which is at odds with all of what has gone before, obviously.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Captured almost straight to tape '<b>Torres</b>' is an album of often simple and sparse arrangements, something which is incredibly brave for someone of Scott's tender years to bare her thoughts and ideas on such an open platform. It's quite a personal record from start to finish, which when combined with her fairly rangy vocals and retro sounding electric guitar (which is pretty much lush throughout), ultimately leads to a debut album which is bold, authentic, and full of integrity - quite frankly its utterly brilliant.<br/><br/>You can download '<b>Torres</b>' now, or buy the physical version on CD or Vinyl later this month - <a href="http://torrestorrestorres.com/MUSIC" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.<br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: FALL CITY FALL - VICTUS|<div style="text-align: justify;">The fine lines between hardcore punk, post hardcore and metalcore have been obscured within the last decade, predominantly thanks to the attempts by pigeonholed bands to free themselves of categorisation. So, you have hardcore bands positioning themselves as DIY punk rock, post hardcore acts aspiring to lose the ‘post’ (in an attempt to dodge association with the emo-end of the post hardcore spectrum), and metalcore bands refusing the crossover tag in a bid to keep the metal-heads onside. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The most positive outcome from all this musical rejigging is the slew of bands that have just embraced all three subgenres, instead of worrying about what they are and aren’t. Canada’s <b>Fall City Fall</b> are one of these bands. Fall City Fall are: hardcore punk, post hardcore and metalcore. Signed to the legendary but largely inconsistent <b>Victory Records</b>, Fall City Fall are an extreme rock band made of five young members, including not one but two vocalists. ‘<b>Victus</b>’ is their Victory debut, and it’s half an hour of intense, penetrating hardcore, laced with occasional melody, intricate time signatures and bruising breakdowns. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Opener ‘<b>St. James</b>’ serves as a short, slow-burning but brutal introduction, before the <i>Every Time I Die</i> influenced ‘<b>Dissentipede</b>’ kicks in with its vocal swagger and frenetic metalcore riffing. The majority of ‘Victus’ follows a similar, winning formula: fast-paced riffing and punk rock drums effortlessly glide into phases of progressive noodlings or post hardcore melody, before or after a <i>Hatebreed</i>-heavy breakdown. Tracks like ‘<b>Anxiety Attack</b>’ and ‘<b>Shallow Believer</b>’ showcase Fall City Fall’s advanced ability to create angry and technical hardcore music, with the latter featuring some hectic <i>Dillinger Escape Plan</i>-esque noise. Only ‘<b>Many Lives</b>’ offers a brief period of calm, but with its haunting prog guitar lines, the instrumental is more eerie than soothing. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p746Yh1NoWU/URfmX_1YjUI/AAAAAAAAEY8/5h1a07X2NFs/s1600/577401_491192477580515_45211604_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-p746Yh1NoWU/URfmX_1YjUI/AAAAAAAAEY8/5h1a07X2NFs/s400/577401_491192477580515_45211604_n.jpg" width="400"/></a>The record highlights come in the form of the impressive closing couplet: ‘<b>Taken</b>’ and ‘<b>Victus</b>’. ‘Taken’ is a slow, controlled moment of chaos, starting with quiet guitars and screamed vocals, progressively getting heavier and fuller, with an escalating, piercing siren sound adding menace in the background. Think a mini version of <i>Converge’s</i> title track from ‘<i>Jane Doe</i>’. The closing title track is an amalgamation of soaring post hardcore and crashing breakdowns, with pained screams and moments of guitar melody, reminiscent of <i>The Bled</i> circa ‘<i>Pass The Flask</i>’. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The dual vocals of <b>Zorn</b> and <b>Pylychaty </b>are visceral and oddly complementary. The low-end growls are heavier than most hardcore vocal performances, while the screamed segments carry a bit of <i>Frank Carter’s</i> impassioned cries during his time fronting <i>Gallows</i> – the sound of unrestrained violence, conveyed all the more convincingly because you can comprehend the lyrics through the noise. Intermittent moments of pained vocal melody come in the form of the now commonplace off-key whine (à la <i>Daryl Palumbo</i>, <i>Keith Buckley,</i> <i>Jason Butler</i>). Fitting, but uninspired. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nonetheless, Fall City Fall have crafted a near-perfect debut record. Brutal but accessible, it’s crowd-pleasing in their inclusion of headbanging breakdowns, and progressive in their use of innovative mathcore and melody. Personally, I rank ‘Victus’ alongside the modern masterpieces by <i>Converge</i> (‘All We Love We Live Behind’), <i>Letlive.</i> (‘Fake History’) and <i>Vision Of Disorder</i> (‘The Cursed remain Cursed’) for sheer passion, but also for successfully bridging hardcore, post hardcore and metalcore without pretentious mutations of the subgenres’ – um – cores. Absolutely thrilling stuff. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fallcityfall" target="_blank"><b>Fall City Fall</b></a> // <a href="http://www.victoryrecords.com/" target="_blank"><b>Victory Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: HANDBOOK - TITANOMACHY|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yFgjwG_06tI/URLbTKg8p_I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/pYoVuzB6MT8/s1600/2647802178-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yFgjwG_06tI/URLbTKg8p_I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/pYoVuzB6MT8/s320/2647802178-1.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Handbook</b> (<i>Jake Brown</i>), all the way from York (the old one not the <i>New</i> one) messes with vintage disco, Motown, soul and hip hop hooks, relentless stuttering cut-off and loops, and just the right beats. '<b>Titanomachy</b>' is an album of danceable yet melodically appealing unadulterated remixes; Brown keeps the vintage soul of his samples alive.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It’s the relentless stuttering loop/cut-off effect of catchy hooks that really gets into your bones. Stand outs include '<b>Feet Feet</b>' with an intensely listenable disco-style flute solo (yes - disco flute) that flickers in a loop/cut-off effect over funk beats and bongos. Irresistible too is '<b>If I</b>' with a looped melodic vocal hook – a laid back soul feel with masterfully layered on subtle and solid beats, this is the sort of track that’s hard to switch off. Opening track '<b>All is Not As it Seems</b>'  hits you with afro sized vocal fanfares and light beats in a 70’s Motown mix up – Brown again manages to create a sound that’s  catchy, danceable, laid back and loud.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Those Days</b>' plays with old school rap and deeper beats, whilst '<b>Ultimatum</b>' steps away from disco towards the vintage Brooklyn hip hop feel: tasty funk guitar looped at the front of mix and male vocal and rap at the back. It’s a dreamy funk piece with attitude. Brown takes it down for tracks like '<b>Zero</b>' – a sensitively mixed soul track with funk beats and emotional perceptivity - and the atmospheric and quirky '<b>Neurotic</b>' – with stuttering drops into silence and auto-tune disco vocal.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We hope to catch this guy live soon, but for now head to <a href="http://handbook.bandcamp.com/album/titanomachy" target="_blank"><b>bandcamp</b></a> to check him out and download the album<b>. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Handbookah" target="_blank">Handbook</a></b><br/><b> </b> </div>||
ALBUM : WIHT - THE HARROWING OF THE NORTH|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wphw9q8UnbM/UQbqv-xrvLI/AAAAAAAAETg/Lojph2ytqhM/s1600/300.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wphw9q8UnbM/UQbqv-xrvLI/AAAAAAAAETg/Lojph2ytqhM/s200/300.jpg" width="200"/></a></div>Stoner rock has always been the territory of the American yee-haw bands. Across the vast Atlantic however, the correlating British scene struggled to compete. We have grey skies and gloomy post-industrial towns, not sun soaked beaches and expansive deserts - our home grown contemporaries were always going to be different to their cowboy hat wearing cousins.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So when the now defunct, Leeds based, post-doom-sludge-whateverists <b>Wiht</b> decided to write an instrumental album about <i>William the Conqueror</i> ravaging the North of England, it was always going to be a distinctly English affair. Their final record, ‘<b>The Harrowing of the North</b>’ is a mere two tracks (plus a lengthy bonus track) but is a veritable epic of stoner rock enormity and post rock exploration. Each twist and turn in this capricious monster, from sparkling single notes, wailing guitars and tinkering cymbals to the gigantic, heavy, fuzzed out riffs and booming drums all serve as analogies for William’s marauding armies across the maudlin North, and events leading up to his remorseful deathbed 20 years later.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wiht might have set themselves a staggering task writing such a record but they manage to convey drama in their music with such aplomb, the entire project is a seemingly effortless success.. ‘The Harrowing...’ is a joy to behold. A swerving, organic beast that you can’t take your ears off, intense and bursting with energy, doom-filled and ominous, it leaves you flabbergasted. This release, in the wake of Wiht’s demise, should be honoured in a fashion akin to the work of any deceased artist of note: with a reverence and awe becoming of a masterpiece, for this record is indeed fitting of such a lofty label. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">‘<b>The Harrowing of the North</b>’ is out 4th February on <a href="http://www.devouterrecords.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank"><b>Devouter Records</b></a>. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wihtleeds?fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Wiht</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
SINGLE: IVORY SEAS - STILL BROODING / MOTHERS TONGUE|<div style="text-align: justify;">Tapping the ambient pop vein, <b>Ivory Seas</b> sew together melodic movement and musical minimalism to create atmospheric tracks ready for the deep icy stills of the British winter. Double A-side with "<b>Mother's Tongue</b>," '<b>Still Brooding</b>' offers a musical chill with a sound truly evocative of the stillness of an icy landscape.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ivory Seas</b>, who met and got together at Southampton University, compare themselves to popular electronic minimalists such as <i>Antlers</i> and <i>The XX</i>. With their catchy stripped back melodies underlaid by cool ambient sound scattered with sparse yet bold instrumentals the comparison seems apt.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Stripping sound back to stillness without losing the upbeat vibe is what Ivory Seas do well. With clever use of instrumental space and silence - '<b>Still Brooding</b>' has ambient sounds rolled over by clever drum beats courtesy of <i>George Batham</i>, sparse undistorted electronic guitar and wintery lyrics that add to the surreal poetics of the track.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Mother's Tongue</b>' makes great use of tubular bell/xylophone and deeply ambient backing vocals (<i>Adam Heron</i> and <i>Thomas Walker</i>) that transforms a standard bass/guitar/drum set up into something festive and melodic yet subtle and surreal, a dark watery sound that skilfully ripples the surface just enough to make you smile. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivoryseas" target="_blank"><b>Ivory Seas</b></a> // <a href="http://ivoryseas.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Buy 7" White Vinyl</b></a></div>||
EXCLUSIVE: ALCOPOP! Cat in a Hat 2013 Compilation #30|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Alcopop!</b> have been one of the most featured labels during the past 6 years of <b><i>Music Liberation</i></b>, so it was with much delight that the Oxford based record label recently got in touch about a unique mini compilation they had made for us (as well as one for each of the 49 other blogs that took part in the '<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/the-blog-sound-of-2013-top-5.html" target="_blank"><b>Blog Sound Of 2013</b></a>'). </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The compilation showcases a brand new track from <b>Stagecoach</b> titled '<b>Threequel</b>', who we picked up on back in <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2009/10/new-music-stagecoach-sweet-serenades.html" target="_blank"><b>2009</b></a>. Alongside the awesome music, there's also a picture of a cat (yeah, a cat, not a dog...), which each of the other blogs comps also featuring a different cat. That's nice right!

SINGLE: MARIKA HACKMAN - BATH IS BLACK|<div style="text-align: justify;">Ahead of <b>Marika Hackman's</b> debut record in the form of the mini album '<b>That Iron Taste</b>', she recently unveiled an acoustic video for the track '<b>Bath is Black</b>'. It is the first in a series of acoustic videos for each of the albums tracks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The album, produced by Alt-J's <i>Charlie Andrew</i>, is set to be released through <b>Dirty Hit</b> on 25th February, with Marika supporting the release with some gigs with <i>Ethan Johns</i>, as well as her own headline tour in March.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Bath Is Black</b>' is wonderfully refreshing in what can sometimes be a stale folk genre. Starting with some delightful guitar finger picking, its Marika's vocals and poignant lyrics which really stand out here. Her voice has a delicate yet somehow knowing quality which belies her tender years, and you can't help but get drawn into her spell of weaving guitar and floating vocals with the song even changing tempo mid track almost seamlessly. The video itself is shot in an old tunnel somewhere in the North of England, and although simple fits the nature of the track really well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are darker undertones throughout this song, a trait which you can't help feel will be repeated on the forthcoming album. That thought not only builds intrigue ahead of the albums release but also further enhances the reputation of someone who is rather quickly building a steadfast fan-base and critical opinion.  <a href="http://www.marikahackman.com/" target="_blank"><b>Marika Hackman</b></a> // <a href="http://www.dirtyhit.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Dirty Hit</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||

MUSIC LIBERATION TOP 10 ALBUMS OF 2012|<div style="text-align: justify;">Here's this year's top 10 albums list from <b>Music Liberation</b>. Whilst we didn't quite get to review all of the albums we'd have like to have this year, I feel the records we did get to were all really strong and as a result it was a difficult but wholly enjoyable process of narrowing down the final list you see before you. Hopefully you'll discover something new here you might have missed this year, and at the bottom of the post we also mention those albums we really rated but didn't quite get round to reviewing. 2012 has been a superb year for new music and fortunately for us it only looks like continuing into the new year and beyond. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks for reading, listening, and engaging with Music Liberation this year, we'll be back in 2013 slightly fatter, older, and in some cases greyer, but we'll promise to keep up our desire to review and support the best in new music from across the globe. If you'd like to submit your music to us then please head <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/p/contact.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>, and if you'd like to join the team and write some reviews then go <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/p/writers.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers! x</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><b>Jon Sidwell (Editor)</b></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"<b>Tall Ships</b> have been on our radar for quite some time now, with us first covering them back in March 2010 with a review of their self titled EP. The trio from Falmouth (now based in Brighton) are signed with the impressive Big Scary Monsters, and Everything Touching is their debut record out as a split release with Blood And Biscuits...<b>Everything Touching</b> is quite possibly one of the best albums you'll hear all year, you just don't know it yet, and for that matter, neither do I, yet. You see this is a complex album which requires several listens to really grasp the depth of ideas this band have put forward over the ten tracks. Some moments are instant, others might take a while longer, but I'm deadly sure that at some point the penny will drop for all...To sum up this album I'll use a vastly overused word - <b>EPIC."</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>"Just listen to the opening couplet of '<b>Attack On Memory</b>' – and you'll barely recognise them. '<b>No Future / No Past</b>' is slow-burning, moody alternative-rock – not a million miles away from Pixies, with grumbling bass and eerie whining building to an exhilarating last minute in which Baldi screams “no future, no past” repeatedly. Darker, angrier, and a damn lot better than anything Baldi has written before. However, the second track '<b>Wasted Days</b>' is not just the best song of their career, it's the best alternative song of the last few months. At nearly 9 minutes, it's much longer than anything else on the album, but it never feels excessively strung-out. Starting off as a simple garage-punk number with a massive vocal hook, it soon gets stuck into a progressive, vocal-less groove, with bubbling sonic textures and climbing, post-hardcore guitars. It’s sprawling, but the climb is never without precision, and the heavy conclusion features Baldi's best ever vocal performance – barking-then-screaming “<i>I thought I would be more that this</i>” over and over with some mighty, mighty passion. It is <i>huge</i>."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"It’s a giant of a record; greater than the sum of its rackety and screeching parts, greater even than the crazy trio that fused it all together in a seaside lab full of smoking, bubbling liquids in glass beakers. The twisting, rich guitar riffs dance around horrendously huge staccato rhythms in some kind of punk / dance insanity that that gives zero fucks to what genre it may or may not fit into, whilst echo-drenched vocals occasionally wail out between the ensuing carnage...Look, whatever, it’s stunning. Words are limited, music is infinite and this is one of the most exciting records in years. It it self indulgent?  Yes. Is it inaccessible? Most probably. Is it genius? No doubt. Think <i>Holy Fuck</i>. Think <i>Sleigh Bells</i>. Think <i>World’s End Girlfriend</i>. Think about every electro-punk-rock crossover that you’ve had the displeasure of hearing and then listen to an entire genre being saved by an epic, breath of fresh air that is this album. Inspired, passionate, adventurous and uncompromising, music really doesn't get much better than this."<br/><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Released earlier this year through Bad Panda Records, 'Tokyo Dreamer' is the new album from 17 year old South Korean Sunik Kim. Going under the moniker of Beat Culture, this exceptionally talented young man is already onto album number two, after releasing his debut LP 'Goldenbacked Weaver' in July of last year when he was just 16.His new record, 'Tokyo Dreamer', is a collection of 10 tracks which demonstrates Beat Culture's impeccable knowledge and skills in electronica...The songs that make up <b>Tokyo Dreamer</b> have a great deal of complexity to them and yet somehow <b>Beat Culture</b> seems to make it all sound so simple, and for any audio fan its literally like food for your ears. Taking inspiration from the likes of <i>Burial</i>, <i>James Blake</i>, <i>Fourtet</i>, and <i>Gold Panda</i>, Beat Culture fuses a range of electronic styles such as dub, hip hop, house, and breaks, to create songs which not only get you moving, put you in a really fucking good mood, but can also transport you wherever you'd like to go."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Dead Wolf Situation is the debut full length album from Bath's Hysterical Injury, a band that should need little introduction to you Music Liberation regulars...My favourite song on the album is '<b>Bitch's Balls</b>' (<i>great title</i>), a track which starts stripped back but is slowly added to with a growing intensity, made up of wild guitars, prominent drums, and far out vocals. Concluding with the monstrous '<b>Rainbow Thunderclap</b>', the '<b>Dead Wolf Situation</b>' experience is one that leaves you feeling part exhausted, part overwhelmed, part enlightened, but in the end wholly satisfied and entirely captivated. As debut albums go its certainly sets the bar high, which will not only challenge those bands around them, but also will surely push the <b>Hysterical Injury</b> onto even greater things in the future. A thought which I hope you'll agree is more than tantalising..."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
Merry Christmas 2012 : First Aid Kit - Blue Christmas|<div style="text-align: justify;">Merry Christmas from all at <b>Music Liberation</b>! Here's <b>First Aid Kit</b> with this years song, their cover of '<b>Blue Christmas</b>'.</div>||
MUSIC LIBERATION - TOP 10 EP'S OF 2012|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Slept And Did Not Sleep</b> is gloriously experimental but still retains a clear melodic and accessible edge. Comparisons could be drawn with the likes of <i>Wu Lyf</i>, <i>Foals</i>, <i>Late Of The Pier</i>, and <i>Everything Everything</i>, but really <b>Ninetails</b> have their own independent sound. You'll pick up different things on each listen of this record making it a real joy for the ears every time. The potential for this band on a full length release is quite tantalising, as is the impact these songs must have on a live audience."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"This debut self titled EP from <b>Wolf Alice</b> has a really strong 'feel good' quality to it, with plenty of summery vibes emanating throughout amongst a lush futuristic far away sound-scape . It's perfect for dipping in and out of as the dreamy folky pop songs carry you whether you'd like to go, almost catching you by surprise at how well put together, thought out, and open they are. It's a tantalizing glimpse at the potential this group clearly has, and we look forward to watching them develop over the time to come."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"Salò’s debut EP is certainly a necessary listen for any fans of the bands name-checked in this review. They have struck an ideal position between math-core experimentalism and melodic post-hardcore – all the while clinging onto a straight-up, hardcore-punk-rock essence, and even splicing some garage-y jangle into the guitars."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Samoans</b> are a three-piece from Cardiff in Wales that have been on my personal radar since 2009-ish when I caught them playing the infamous <i>Clwb Ifor Bach</i> in the Welsh capital. Their style of math-rock inspired guitar music caught my attention straight away and I've been following them ever since. It has been somewhat of a wait then until '<b>Elevated Reflections</b>', their debut EP to come out, however the wait has been more than worth it. The music is melodic, heavy in parts, but also tender too, with the standout track being '<b>Catamaran</b>'."</div><div style="text-align: justify;">"This simple record is nothing if not brave as Wilson’s self-indulgent approach to music may leave some frustrated. These three solemn songs could struggle for mass appeal as they are cyclical in nature, without the salvation of catchy hooks or crowd pleasing string accompaniments. Yet her basic – almost amateur – approach to writing and recording is her strength. In a genre full of cover songs and faux emotion here we are offered sincerity and truth on a plate with what feels like a healthy disregard for popular expectation. It’s refreshing."</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||

For those unaware of this interesting snapshot from the blogosphere here's Robin from the <a href="http://www.breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Breaking More Waves</b></a> blog to explain more.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">"The Blog Sound Poll was first published in <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/blog-sound-of-2012.html" target="_blank">2011</a>. The concept of the poll wasn’t to criticise the established BBC Sound of list, but simply an experiment to see if UK music bloggers could come up with its own list of emerging artists that was more representative of their community and give the artists that were nominated some extra publicity. Indeed the idea was to compliment the BBC list in many ways by providing an alternative to compare and contrast.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Last year’s final long list provided some interesting alternatives to the BBC list; most notably it included Alt-J, this year’s Mercury Prize winners, who didn’t feature on the BBC list at all.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Blog Sound of 2013 poll has expanded with 49 UK blogs nominating their 5 favourite emerging artists. Just over 170 acts received at least 1 vote. The winning act received votes from around 25% of all bloggers. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The poll was organised by <i>Robin Seamer</i> (<a href="http://www.breakingmorewaves.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank"><i>Breaking More Waves</i></a>) and <i>Andy Von Pip</i> (<a href="http://www.thevpme.com/" target="_blank">The Von Pip Express</a>). Each blog was allowed to vote for five acts and the diversity of the nominations was staggering. Based on the evidence of the spread of votes anyone that says that music bloggers are sheep and are all writing about the same artists has got it wrong. However, the results of the poll show that certain artists do have a lot of support and love from a significant portion of UK bloggers and those artists make up the Blog Sound of 2013 list,”.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So here's the results! (We'll be revealing the top 5 and winner of the <b>Blog Sound of 2013</b> on January 3rd, and we'll also let you know who <b>Music Liberation</b> picked in our customary <b>Future Sounds</b> feature, suffice to say that one of our picks has made the long-list, you can probably guess who!) </div>||
NEW MUSIC: MARIKA HACKMAN|<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vv_QxDffovM/ULJ9bZSxvzI/AAAAAAAAD7A/d9o8lAvK0o4/s1600/avatars-000018472088-yrcz0d-crop.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vv_QxDffovM/ULJ9bZSxvzI/AAAAAAAAD7A/d9o8lAvK0o4/s320/avatars-000018472088-yrcz0d-crop.jpg" width="320"/></a><b>Marika Hackman</b> is a twenty-year old from London, who earlier this year released her debut material in the shape of a double a-side single '<b><a href="http://soundcloud.com/marika-hackman/marika-hackman-you-come-down" target="_blank"><i>You Come Down</i></a></b>' and '<a href="http://soundcloud.com/marika-hackman/marika-hackman-mountain-spines" target="_blank"><b><i>Mountain Spines</i></b></a>' through Transgressive offshoot <i>Paradyse Records</i>. She recently supported <i>Benjamin Francis Leftwich</i>, and this week she sets out on her own mini headline tour of the UK. Theres also been a 5-track covers EP which has been floating around for a little while, with acts such as <i>Warpaint</i>, <i>Nirvana</i>, <i>Nico</i>, <i>The Knife</i>, and <i>Dusty Springfield</i> all receiving the 'Hackman treatment'. It's fair to say then that she's been a pretty busy lady of late, and with 2013 just round the corner and mentions of further material appearing soon, she's shows no sign of slowing down. But what of her style? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well it's folk, but not the happy-go-lucky paint-by-numbers stuff, she has much greater resolve, ideas, and complexity to fit into that bracket. Her voice has great depth, and a dark edge which hints at someone who has done her musical homework and absorbed a wide range of different influences and styles. Returning to the aforementioned EP it is not just the calibre of artists that have been covered, but the approach Marika has taken with it that really shines through, as she brazenly implements her stripped back ideas almost completely transforming the songs into her own material. The cover of '<i>Lithium</i>' by <i>Nirvana</i> in particular stands out, but each track has its own charm. Overall it's a striking listening experience and a tantalising glimpse at what our ears could look forward to next year with the release of new material. We're excited...</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Check out the covers EP and forthcoming headline tour dates<i><b> &gt;&gt;&gt; </b></i> <a href="http://www.marikahackman.com/" target="_blank"><b>www.marikahackman.com</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Marika-Hackman/113617992037814?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Marika Hackman</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
EP: NINETAILS - SLEPT AND DID NOT SLEEP|<div style="text-align: justify;">Signed to <b>Superstar Destroyer Records </b>(<i>awesome name</i>), Liverpools' <b>Ninetails</b> follow up their debut EP '<i>Ghost Ride The Whip</i>' with their new record '<b>Slept And Did Not Sleep</b>'. Straight off I'll let you know I think it's an incredibly ambitious sounding album that arrives with an ever increasing fanfare from the likes of <i>This Is Fake DIY</i> and <i>Clash Magazine</i>. Having already shared stages with <i>Alt-J</i>, <i>Tall Ships</i>, and <i>Errors</i>, Ninetails have certainly built up a strong reputation already despite their short history together as a band.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The 5-track EP kicks with '<b>Maybe We</b>', a defiant opening of rumbling bass and distant guitars which is slowly transformed into a full on rhythmical beast, featuring soaring guitars and transfixing drums, alongside otherworldly vocals. It's a strong opening which sounds really complete and together showing a band clearly in tune with their ideas and intentions. '<b>Body Clock</b>' follows with offbeat drums, intentionally ambiguous vocals, and yet more gorgeous guitars creating those floating hands in the air, slow motion moments. The ending of the song is drawn out, with the band veering off into experimental territory with sound coming and going with various moments of feedback, synths, and drones. For the second track on the record it's a brave decision to stray off the beaten track so early, but it works ever so well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Fawdon Fever</b>' is next up, a stunningly groove laden track which never ceases to bore, with the intricate and melodic guitars proving hard to not get consumed by. '<b>Boxed In</b>' is an odd track, being almost devoid of any apparent rhythm or melody, leaving us with distant futuristic bleeps and drones which if nothing else certainly puts you on edge and wondering what on earth is going on. At over 8 minutes in length its not a track which will appeal to all, but if you like to hear different ideas within your musical palette then you may well find something here for you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Finishing this EP is '<b>Mama Aniseed</b>', a track which seemingly brings together all the elements which have gone before it. There's the experimental electronic moments, melodic guitars, offbeat drums, as well as the first proper introduction to <b>Ed Black's</b> vocals. For me its the guitars which really suck me in with Ninetails, with the delicate riffs and finger picking complimenting the drums perfectly, leading to those brilliant moments of music which just feel completely right, emphatically suiting whatever mood you're in.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Released on December 10th,<b> Slept And Did Not Sleep</b> is gloriously experimental but still retains a clear melodic and accessible edge. Comparisons could be drawn with the likes of <i>Wu Lyf</i>, <i>Foals</i>, <i>Late Of The Pier</i>, and <i>Everything Everything</i>, but really <b>Ninetails</b> have their own independent sound. You'll pick up different things on each listen of this record making it a real joy for the ears every time. The potential for this band on a full length release is quite tantalising, as is the impact these songs must have on a live audience. Speaking of which the band are playing their first London date at the Bull and Gate on November 29th, alongside the Music Liberation endorsed <i>Crushing Blows</i>. We'll see you there!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://ninetailsband.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Ninetails</b></a> // <a href="http://superstardestroyer.bandcamp.com/album/slept-and-did-not-sleep" target="_blank"><b>Stream/Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.superstardestroyer.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Superstar Destroyer Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
EP: TO KILL A KING - WORD OF MOUTH|<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qXb-MvUf47k/UJwsj6TzRGI/AAAAAAAAD3Y/cNY1NJGlWS8/s1600/391591_502814853079014_1952590182_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qXb-MvUf47k/UJwsj6TzRGI/AAAAAAAAD3Y/cNY1NJGlWS8/s320/391591_502814853079014_1952590182_n.jpg" width="320"/></a>Hailing from London, <b>To Kill A King</b> may seem a little bit cliché on the surface. They formed at university in Leeds, and they wear the '<i>oh so hip</i>' folk-rock-indie-pop label of so many of their peers - it might be easy for this delightful little band to wash over you altogether. Don't let them, there is a lot more ambition evident here than meets the eye, if latest EP '<b>Word of Mouth</b>' is anything to go by.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you heard To Kill A King on the radio, the sharp guitars coupled with <i>Ralph Pelleymounter's</i> croon may evoke a juxtaposition of <i>Editors</i> and <i>Coldplay</i>. However, put this EP through a decent set of headphones on a cold walk home, perhaps thinking of someone special, and it becomes clear that these guys have the potential to go far.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The EP kicks off with '<b>Howling</b>'. Warm, bass filled synth flood the ears - quickly giving way to ambitious multi-instrumentation that will undoubtedly evoke thoughts of <i>The National</i> and delicate vocal harmonies that will pull at the heartstrings. Building to a powerful metallic climax, this really is a great start. Remarkably, To Kill A King ease into top gear on '<b>Funeral</b>', with the intro easily adding shine to any Apple ad, giving way to a tour-de-force in really great song-craft.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Things slow down with '<b>Besides She Said</b>', whereas '<b>Wolves</b>' is a bright, catchy modern indie song with the obligatory anthemic chorus. Momentum builds once again with the brilliant <b>'Rays'</b>, which is rousing indie-pop at it's best, evoking the highlights of big hitters such as <i>Bombay Bicycle Club</i>. Intricate guitars are underpinned with a tight, flexible bass line and a masterful vocal performance from Pelleymounter, ending in a frantic flurry of drums and hi-hat. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Closing track '<b>Let It Die</b>' demonstrates the emotional maturity of the lyrics that run through the heart of this EP. "<i>The saddest part of a broken heart isn't the end so much as the start</i>" will remain with you long after the final chords fade away. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Give me a broken heart any time if it means the start of something this special.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://tokillaking.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>To Kill A King</b></a> // <a href="http://tokillaking.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><b>Buy 'Word Of Mouth' EP</b></a><br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F53087258&amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe></div>||
EP: OLILOQUY - THE RED EP|<div style="text-align: justify;">Next up from London’s <b>Sup Peeps Records</b> comes <b>The Red EP</b>, the first of a ‘<i>Three Colours Trilogy</i>’ from <b>Oliloquy</b> (aka <i>CIRCLE</i>), provider of two of the jazziest, funkiest tunes (and a remix) on the label’s introductory two-disc '<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/album-sup-peeps-start-collecting.html" target="_blank"><b>Start Collecting</b></a>' and coming in at only 6 songs long, I decided I would push the boat out and cover each one.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Due for both physical and digital release on Halloween, those expecting the same laidback, jazz-infused vibe from this EP may be disappointed as there is not a trumpet flare or flute flourish to be found. Bare with me though, it’s still worth a listen.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">An ominous, plodding beat sets off intro track ‘<b>Circle’s Theme 1</b>’, building into a gloriously glitch-ridden bass-fest before ‘<b>Borealis</b>’, the EP’s most chilled number, calms things down for a bit. Things get almost cheery on ‘<b>Intelligence</b>’, a good Electronica-inspired track (to my uncouth, Hip Hop-tainted ears, anyway) but it seems a bit too polished which makes it stand out a bit among the murkier EP highlights. The opening of ‘<b>BATS!</b>’ reminded this old drum &amp; bass head of <i>Mampi Swift</i> in his ‘<i>Jaws</i>’ days- never a bad thing. Add a tasty bit of scratching, a familiar-sounding melody that floats in and out and a grimy bassline and the result? A nodding head and thumbs up from me.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">‘<b>Additive</b>’ is a downtempo, almost uneasy listen at first; a droning organ-like sample plus some distorted scratches lead you to think it is another Borealis-esque track. Then the bassline slams in. It is crunchy and chewy and spectacular. I can see this track going down well at whatever the equivalent of a rave is these days (still raves? Someone enlighten me).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Rounding off this brief extended player in epic form is ‘<b>Invaders From Wherever</b>’, stuffed full of chest-rattling bass, stirring melodies and non-annoying glitch-synth bits (technical term). I’m sure I heard bongo drums just before that first drop too and you can’t not love a tune that features bongos, right? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So to sum up, this isn’t one for the acoustic folk lovers. If you like your music bassy, glitchy and covered in synths, you should definitely give <b>The Red EP</b> a listen. Do me one favour when you do though- listen to it on a decent set of speakers, eh? Those tinny little things on your laptop will never do this EP justice. Not in a million years.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Circle-AKA-Oliloquy/183931891637597" target="_blank"><b>Oliloquy</b></a> // <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/qid=1349435860/ref=sr_grid_albumrank?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=Oliloquy&amp;index=digital-music&amp;rd=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;search-type=ss&amp;sort=albumrank" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://suppeeps.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sup Peeps Records</b></a><br/><br/></div>||
ALBUM: CITIZENS - CTZNS|<div style="text-align: justify;">2012 has been a little quiet on the UK hardcore front. There were some excellent releases last year – with <b>Shapes</b>’ ‘<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/album-review-shapes-monotony-chic.html" target="_blank"><i>Monotony Chic</i></a>’ and <b>The Computers</b>’ ‘<i>This Is The Computers</i>’ becoming two of my favourite noisy albums of the last few years. However, nothing has really stood out this year, at least not to this bored reviewer. However, the debut album from Glasgow trio <b>Citizens</b> – titled ‘<b>CTZNS</b>’ – arrived in my inbox this week, and all of a sudden I was bored no longer.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having released two well-received EPs – including the formidable ‘<b>Try Harder</b>’ EP – and built up a rather respectable live reputation, one might have expected Citizens to take their time constructing their first full length. WRONG. ‘<b>CTZNS</b>’ was recorded in a single day, live! Yet, the production quality is remarkably fine, especially considering the erratic and heavy nature of the music. For this we must surely commend the engineer and studio (<i>Bruce Rintoul</i> and <i>Lofi Studio</i>, Glasgow), as well as the impressive tightness of the trio’s instrumentation.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Citizens make hectic, progressive hardcore – with experimental time signatures, frantic riffing, emotive and throaty vocals, and punk rock pacing. There are snippets of post hardcore in the more melodic or jangly segments of ‘CTZNS’, such as the first half of ‘<b>Heavy Breather</b>’ (before the punishing, sludgy riff and earthy vocals of the final stretch) or the mid section of the sprawling epic that is closer ‘<b>Distance Blues</b>’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However, for the most part, this is aggressive hardcore punk with math-rock noodlings. Take the 49 second track ‘<b>New Punks</b>’, which despite its short, sharp punk structure, still manages to fit in some jumpy off-kilter guitars. Some of <i>Craig McIntyre’s</i> guitar work is thrilling, such as on the instrumental ‘<b>Hats Off To Phil Differ</b>’ and the glorious, slow burning opener ‘<b>Habitual Smoker Blues</b>’. Previous single ‘<b>Try Harder</b>’ (from the EP of the same name) reappears here, and is perhaps the track that best showcases what Citizens are all about – slow, chunky riffs and ear-splitting screams that evolve into stabbing, proggy playfulness, bouncing alongside<i> Owen Batchelor’s</i> grumbling bass, before a heavy riff mean enough to slay and bury an emo kid dominates the rest of the song. It’s all very <i>Pulled Apart By Horses</i> (before they moved into more alt-rock territory). </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The fact that ‘<b>Woollen Mammoth</b>’ is the album highlight is unmistakable. The quick-fire, stop-start riffing and monumental shifts in structure encapsulate all the best trademarks of post hardcore, progressive hardcore, mathcore – hell, it’s HARDCORE to its…core. Citizens are the best new UK (post) (progressive) hardcore outfit to emerge in 2012, hands down. Their music manages to be intelligent yet accessible, and as heavy as a blissful head-butt in a punk rock mosh pit.

ALBUM: SUP PEEPS - START COLLECTING|<div style="text-align: justify;">London based <b>Sup Peeps Records</b> may not be a familiar name for most- it wasn’t to me anyway, but <b>'Start Collecting'</b>, the first compilation from this enigmatic label is a jazzy, funky, hip hop-ified two-disc rollercoaster that is well worth checking out.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you ask me, when the compilation gets its jazz-funk on is when it is at its strongest. Album opener <b>'Asa715'</b> by <b>Four Leaf Sound</b> and '<b>CIRCLE</b>' aka <b>Oliloquy’s</b> two contributions (<b>'I’ll Drive the Band'</b> and <b>'The Subject Is…'</b>) set the bar high and if you don’t find yourself nodding along to '<b>Sepia Sky</b>' by <b>OdjBox</b>, I simply don’t think we could ever be friends.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Disc two starts strong too. There’s something hypnotic about the bells and vocal sample in <b>Trig’s</b> <b>'Kibou no Kiseki (Track of Hope)'</b> and <b>Jill Peacock</b> shows us on '<b>Up in the Air</b>' that she has a pretty awesome voice.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">A couple of tracks, '<b>Got to Get On Now</b>' by <b>Yuki Kanesaka</b> and '<b>Twist off Cap</b>' by <b>Big Hell</b> feature beats that sound a bit too much like the classic two-step beat of UK Garage for my taste but may conjure nostalgic vibes for those of a similar vintage to me (I was always more of a drum &amp; bass fan myself). They stick out a little among the more laid back tracks but may offer a pleasant change of gears if the jazz gets a bit much for you. The rapper on '<b>Got to Get On Now</b>' will never set the Hip Hop on fire either…</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If you’re a fan of UK Hip Hop, look up <b>Boodacon</b>. His performance on DJ Buzzword’s <b>Small Town Pleasures</b> is (and I’m guessing he’ll hate this comparison if he reads this) reminiscent of <i>Mike Skinner</i>… If Mike Skinner knew how to flow ON a beat instead of around it, although he does veer into ‘talking over the beat’ territory. If the original of Hot Donkey’s Disregard is as funky as Ali Jameson’s remix, then I’m looking them up when I finish this review. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All in all, I’d say <b>Stay Collecting</b> is well worth a listen, or even worth dusting off your wallet. If this is a taste of things to come from <b>Sup Peeps</b>, I recommend making a note of the name and the talented bunch that album A&amp;R <i>Jay Kenny</i> got together.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://suppeeps.com/" target="_blank"><b>Sup Peeps Records</b></a> // <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPGcscCIiwk&amp;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank"><b>Album Trailer</b></a> // <a href="http://soundcloud.com/sup-peeps-records/sets/sup-peeps-start-collecting" target="_blank"><b>Stream/Buy 'Start Collecting'</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>||
ALBUM: TALL SHIPS - EVERYTHING TOUCHING|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tall Ships</b> have been on our radar for quite some time now, with us first covering them back in March 2010 with a review of their <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/ep-review-tall-ships-tall-ships.html" target="_blank"><b>self titled EP</b></a>. The trio from Falmouth (now based in Brighton) are signed with the impressive <b>Big Scary Monsters</b>, and <b>Everything Touching</b> is their debut record out next week on October 8th as a split release with <b>Blood And Biscuits</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The album begins with '<b>T=O</b>', a sumptuous half instrumental <i>Mogwai</i> inspired track which sets the bar ever so high. Vocalist <b>Ric Phethean</b> enters halfway through, but it is the guitars that really shine bright. Launching straight into '<b>Best Ever</b>', the band continue their impressive early <i>Foals-esq</i> mathrock, with once again those guitars really standing out. It's heavy, but also it's not, in a weird way, as the melodic rhythmic nature of the music carries you effortlessly along. Things are slowed a tad for third track '<b>Phosopherence</b>', with Plethean's vocals given more of the limelight. It's a solid track, if nothing spectacular especially after the opening first two tracks. '<b>Oscar</b>' starts in a similar fashion to the previous song, but after a slow start things get ramped up for an emphatic guitars driven ending (<i>ED: yes more guitars!</i>).<br/><br/>'<b>Ode To Ancestors</b>' is simply beautiful, vocally and musically, with the sparseness in the track enhancing everything. Things get moving halfway through and the familiar pattern of group vocals and big guitars takes us through to the end. It builds and builds until you are forced to take notice, but actually it really works well and its a pleasure to let the band take over your mind. The one track I struggle with on this album is '<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa4Y8RO590A" target="_blank"><b>Gallop</b></a>', purely because it reminds me of <i>The Vaccines</i>, with the vocals, and the drumming in particular reminding me of that bloody band (<i>ED: let it go Jon, it was a long time ago...</i>). Did I mention that also happens to be the latest single from the record?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Moving swiftly on, '<b>Idolatry</b>' sounds gigantic, with the band somehow creating even more space and variety in their music. During the six minutes of the track heart strings are tugged, heads are rocked, feet are tapped, and your mind will definitely be taken someplace else. It's a different track to others on the album, with the band moving away from their trusted guitar riffs and being more experimental, and it works, really well. An entire album of tracks just like that would go down very well (<i>ED: hint, hint</i>). '<b>Books</b>' is the thinking mans' song, lyrics about time being precious, interspersed with soaring guitars and big drums. Nice. Final track '<b>Murmurations</b>' is an epic nine-minuter, growing from a distance beat and lone guitar into a full on rhythmic monster with keys, guitars, drums, and vocals all combining to leave a song which is just a joy to listen to again and again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Everything Touching</b> is quite possibly one of the best albums you'll hear all year, you just don't know it yet, and for that matter, neither do I, yet. You see this is a complex album which requires several listens to really grasp the depth of ideas this band have put forward over the ten tracks. Some moments are instant, others might take a while longer, but I'm deadly sure that at some point the penny will drop for all, with the album sure to feature in many top 10's come the end of the year. To sum up this album I'll use a vastly overused word - <b>EPIC.</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://tallshipsband.bigcartel.com/product/everything-touching-cd-album" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order/Buy 'Everything Touching</b></a>' // <a href="http://www.wearetallships.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Tall Ships</b></a> // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bigscarymonsters?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Big Scary Monsters</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bloodandbiscuits?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_blank"><b>Blood And Biscuits</b></a></div>||

And like the Frankensteinian monster it is, debut album ‘<b>Looming</b>’ wanders around, clumsy and aimless, smashing the shit out of anything in its path; mostly, your ears.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It’s a giant of a record; greater than the sum of its rackety and screeching parts, greater even than the crazy trio that fused it all together in a seaside lab full of smoking, bubbling liquids in glass beakers. The twisting, rich guitar riffs dance around horrendously huge staccato rhythms in some kind of punk / dance insanity that that gives zero fucks to what genre it may or may not fit into, whilst echo-drenched vocals occasionally wail out between the ensuing carnage. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Forget hyperbole, this record is genius. Here are some adjectives that are literally being extracted from my head upon listening: Fuck off tonal slabs / Monolithic chunks of analogue blasts / Raw and primal grooves / Rhythmic sucker-punches of distortion / Sonic angularities / Guttural guitar barks / Psychedelic vocal wails / Swaggering stuttery monstrosities / Gargantuan tanks of noise / Red raw strips of vulgar howls / Propulsive instrumentals / Unadulterated guitar riffage / Screaming seas of feedback / Manic explosions of sound / spiky and haunting guitar echos / growling rumbles of square shaped frequencies / ominous and dronal pomposities… </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j6GF1UnUeGY/UF8IrpJW9VI/AAAAAAAADyU/lkse6MdsMss/s1600/7106268641_a7897a986a_z.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j6GF1UnUeGY/UF8IrpJW9VI/AAAAAAAADyU/lkse6MdsMss/s200/7106268641_a7897a986a_z.jpg" width="160"/></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/>Look, whatever, it’s stunning. Words are limited, music is infinite and this is one of the most exciting records in years. It it self indulgent?  Yes. Is it inaccessible? Most probably. Is it genius? No doubt. Think <i>Holy Fuck</i>. Think <i>Sleigh Bells</i>. Think <i>World’s End Girlfriend</i>. Think about every electro-punk-rock crossover that you’ve had the displeasure of hearing and then listen to an entire genre being saved by an epic, breath of fresh air that is this album. Inspired, passionate, adventurous and uncompromising, music really doesn't get much better than this. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The aptly named ‘<b>Looming</b>’ will be released by <b>Small Town America</b>, home of some of the best guitar bands of recent years, on 24th September 2012.

SINGLE: LAURA WELSH - CALL TO ARMS / HOLLOW DRUM|<div style="text-align: justify;">If <b>Laura Welsh</b> turned our heads earlier this year with the introduction of her debut track '<b>Ghosts</b>', then she's making us do cartwheels now with not one but two brand new tracks, '<b>Call To Arms</b>', and '<b>Hollow Drum</b>'.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Both tracks show off her remarkable voice, which really does need to be heard, any words I could write will never do it justice. While the music itself is sparse but perfectly arranged. Little is known about her at this stage, but if the quality of tracks released so far is anything to go by then that won't last for long.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://laurawelsh.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"><b>Laura Welsh</b></a> / <a href="http://soundcloud.com/laurawelsh" target="_blank"><b>Soundcloud</b></a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/laurawelshofficial" target="_blank"><b>Facebook</b></a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/_laurawelsh" target="_blank"><b>Twitter</b></a></div>||
EP: CARA MITCHELL - HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED|<div style="text-align: justify;">At just 16 years of age, Scottish lass <b>Cara Mitchell </b>could be forgiven for filling her young mind with many different thoughts, from aspirations for the future, ideas of discovery, or just deciding whether or not it's possible to fit another episode of '<i>Hollyoaks</i>' into a busy night of television viewing (<i>ED: Young people still watch Hollyoaks right?</i>). And whilst she may indeed spend her time contemplating such things, she has also managed to fit into her schedule the writing and recording of her debut EP '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>'.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Released through <b>AGP</b> on September 23rd, the four-track record begins with the title track '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>', a truly simple yet glorious folk song, which introduces Cara's delicate vocals and her obvious ear for space within her music. '<b>Passing Sun</b>' furthers the strength of her infectious vocals, but it is the combination of her excellent hard/soft acoustic guitar which enhances the poignancy of the lyrics she's singing. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSrZtMQ7T6o/UFJI0oPUocI/AAAAAAAADvE/TRe4QuXh5UA/s1600/Cara+Trend+2+(FILEminimizer).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="135" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSrZtMQ7T6o/UFJI0oPUocI/AAAAAAAADvE/TRe4QuXh5UA/s200/Cara+Trend+2+(FILEminimizer).jpg" width="200"/></a> </div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Next October</b>' shows a greater depth to her voice, which should only get better as she gets older, albeit she might lose that quirky daintiness which comes from being so young. The EP closes with '<b>Little Birdies</b>', another perfectly formed track which introduces yet another style of singing from Cara, which is more jaunty and direct helping to put you in the moment, where if you close your eyes you really could imagine walking through a forest, with the sun shining, and the birds singing. Bliss.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cara Mitchell's</b> debut EP '<b>Have You Ever Wondered</b>' does more than just show much promise, it actually delivers straight off the bat. Never has the '<i>maturity beyond her years</i>' tag appeared more deservedly on  <b>Music Liberation</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">You can catch Cara supporting <i>Esperi</i> during their UK tour during September/October. // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CaraMitchellMusic/app_139114646178872" target="_blank"><b>Pre-Order EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.caramitchell.net/" target="_blank"><b>Cara Mitchell</b></a></div>||
SINGLE REVIEW: DEAD WOLF CLUB - RADAR|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tmxDdsc5Yqc/TzQ1yJDX-kI/AAAAAAAADaM/rAsY8RFbFFE/s1600/dwci.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tmxDdsc5Yqc/TzQ1yJDX-kI/AAAAAAAADaM/rAsY8RFbFFE/s320/dwci.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Dead Wolf Club</b> are pretty energetic. Single ‘<b>Radar</b>’ starts with a lone guitar line that sounds like the song is going to explode into a raging flurry of head-nodding, chaotic rhythms and riffs that will make you want to lose track of space and time in a dingy indie club somewhere off <i>Charing Cross Road</i> as you slowly inhale tequila and cover yourself in a thin balm of stale beer and sickly sweat on a packed dance floor.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It’s unfortunate then that such a hypnotic climax seems just out of reach for the ambitious teenage foursome. When ‘Radar’ does kick in, it’s less explosive than expected and instead is a brooding ride that tips its hat firmly at <i>Interpol</i>. Vocals are angsty wails that sit over minor key progressions whilst propulsive drums stimulate the snare-to-neck nerve endings a treat. Proceedings are rudely interrupted however in the form of a stuttering bridge that means that when we get to the soaring chorus, intensity is lost. A minor nag perhaps but enough to break the spell, put down the tequila and think about work tomorrow.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In all honesty, the intro of ‘Radar’ might be ‘<i>Last Night</i>’ by <i>The Stokes</i>, the middle Interpol and the end stolen from ‘<i>Banquet</i>’ by <i>Bloc Party</i> but so what? Dead Wolf Club make a bold enough musical statement here that this song has a charm of its own. The band call their music “<i>dark punk</i>” but this single is a no nonsense slice of indie rock nostalgia. Couple this with an apparent reputation for vitriolic live shows and smashed guitars and it starts to become impossible to not like this promising bunch.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dead Wolf Club</b> are smashing guitars and being vitriolic all over the UK with a tour to celebrate the release of their <a href="http://www.deadwolfclub.com/">debut self titled album</a>, which came out earlier this month through <a href="http://www.scenenotherd.org/"><b>Scene Not Herd</b></a>. // <a href="http://www.deadwolfclub.com/"><b>DEAD WOLF CLUB</b></a></div>||
LIVE REVIEW : Lucy Rose at the Jazz Cafe (Camden, London, 4th February 2012)|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZuMbdrGE2M/TzGbRXDBEwI/AAAAAAAADZ8/Vsgpi1IuBqU/s1600/182625_183949488308402_150865674950117_370582_1783502_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1ZuMbdrGE2M/TzGbRXDBEwI/AAAAAAAADZ8/Vsgpi1IuBqU/s320/182625_183949488308402_150865674950117_370582_1783502_n.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>Having made the <b>Music Liberation</b> '<a href="http://www.musicliberation.blogspot.com/2012/01/future-sounds-of-2012.html">Future Sounds of 2012</a>' list,<b> Lucy Rose</b> was a name we were always going to look out for during the year ahead. So when the opportunity came about to catch her playing her largest gig to date at the <b>Jazz Cafe</b> in <b>Camden</b>, we jumped at the chance. Not even the '<i>heavy onslaught</i>' of snow which decided to engulf the capital the moment we set off could dampen the spirits and anticipation of checking out the young lady from Warwickshire, who in a relatively short period of time has gone from being that girl who joins <i>Bombay Bicycle Club</i> from time to time, to being recognised in her own right as an artist with much integrity and a clear desire and confidence to put out her own ideas.<br/><br/>Taking to the stage with a collection of musicians who intermittently appear from one song to the next, Lucy gets things going with '<b>Middle Of The Bed</b>', a track we <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/11/ep-review-lucy-rose-middle-of-bed.html"><b>reviewed last November</b></a>, and a track which neatly demonstrates how infectious her music is. I suppose you could put her in the 'acoustic' bracket, however there is a growing sense of intensity that builds within her songs, emanating from the different instruments which surround Lucy's own fine guitar playing. Whilst her vocals steal the headlines, both from a songwriting perspective and sonically, the music behind her is also of such a standard and complexity that the combination is really quite mesmerising. With the Jazz Cafe completely sold out (and apparently over sold with some ticket holders turned away at the door) the atmosphere inside was for want of a better word, <i>special</i>.<br/><br/><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TWJSi2OA_fE/Ty5lRvYIcaI/AAAAAAAADZU/hlG_mmZYKIE/s1600/132843978350877999.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TWJSi2OA_fE/Ty5lRvYIcaI/AAAAAAAADZU/hlG_mmZYKIE/s200/132843978350877999.jpg" width="158"/></a>Lucy seemed to grow with confidence as each song went by, not surprising with this being her biggest show to date, and a gig at which she thought '<i>only 20 people</i>' would show up at! Mixing some older songs with new, highlights included '<b>Gamble</b>' (for the record Lucy confirmed she does NOT have a problem with gambling), '<b>Rocking Newbie</b>' (a working title for a song which had its debut live airing), and '<b>Don't You Worry</b>' (a track which you might have heard during the latest episode of <i>Skins</i>, if you're like me and still watch it that is). My favourite track of the night would have to be '<b>Shiver</b>', a beautifully simple song that really puts the spotlight on Lucy's ethereal vocals which draw you in and capture your attention, in much the same way as her contemporaries of the moment <b>Daughter</b>, <b>Gabrielle Aplin</b>, and <b>Kyla La Grange</b>.<br/><br/><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-08HG2BGnTO8/Ty5kEpYYi3I/AAAAAAAADZM/r2la-A0YFKM/s1600/132843978350877.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="161" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-08HG2BGnTO8/Ty5kEpYYi3I/AAAAAAAADZM/r2la-A0YFKM/s200/132843978350877.jpg" width="200"/></a>All too soon the show is over, finishing with her latest single '<b>Red Face</b>', however we do get treated to what Lucy says is her first ever encore, with the time stopping '<b>First</b>' capturing everyones attention one last time. To emphasise how enthralling the gig was one member of the crowd even asked Lucy to play 'Middle Of The Bed' to which she replied "<i>that is a classic but I've already played that one!</i>" This is actually another side to Lucy which developed during the show, her ability to communicate with the crowd on a level that was quite endearing, with her strong stage presence being quite refreshing for someone so young. So all in all a superb gig, and the subsequent battle getting home with the snow and apparent inability of the tube network to deal with it seemed to matter little after witnessing such an enthralling performance.<br/><br/>With her debut album currently being recorded and a trip to America supporting Bombay Bicycle Club to look forward to, Lucy Rose has a very exciting year ahead of her, and we at Music Liberation are certainly looking forward to hearing and watching more of her in the months to come.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lucy-Rose/150865674950117?sk=wall"><b>Lucy Rose</b></a> // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jazzcafecamden"><b>The Jazz Cafe</b></a><b>  // <a href="http://lucyrose.net/">LucyRose.Net</a> </b><i>(excellent fansite for Lucy)</i><b><br/></b></div>||
Music Liberation and ooShirts.com|<div style="text-align: justify;">A little while ago an emerging apparel company from the USA called <a href="http://ooshirts.com/"><b>ooShirts.com</b></a> got in touch to find out whether we would like some <b>Music Liberation</b> tshirts printed. They specialise in creating custom tshirts for their clients, with a user friendly website which makes designing your own professional looking shirts easy. So we gave it a go and were super pleased with the results!<br/><br/>The material of the shirt is of a high quality and the logo itself doesnt feel as if it will peel off in the first wash, something which other similar websites are guilty of. Despite being shipped from the States it arrived quickly too. All in all the process from start to finish was fairly effortless and I'm sure we'll go back to create more designs in the future. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Why not have a go yourself over at <b><a href="http://www.ooshirts.com/">www.ooshirts.com</a>!!</b></div>||
ALBUM REVIEW: CLOUD NOTHINGS - ATTACK ON MEMORY|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cloud Nothings</b> <i>used</i> to be mediocre. Cloud Nothings <i>used</i> to be forgettable. Cloud Nothings <i>used</i> to be a solo-project. Of their show supporting <i>Crocodiles</i> at the <i>Camden Barfly</i>, this time last year, I referred to their “<i>brand of jangly pop-punk</i>” as “<i>upbeat and energetic but exceptionally bland and generic</i>”. However, Cloud Nothings' new record – '<b>Attack On Memory</b>' – is the sound of a band revitalised. It is the sound of a band emerging as <i>vital</i>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Ohio natives Cloud Nothings began as the vehicle for a lone <b>Dylan Baldi</b>, the frontman and principle songwriter who played all the instruments on their first two albums – '<b>Turning On</b>' and the self-titled follow-up. The inadequacies of those first two flat records were hidden behind infectious melodies, with Baldi pushing for bright, DIY pop-punk (with the emphasis on<i> pop</i>) but failing to pen enough memorable guitar or drum parts. Basically, imagine a boring <i>Mazes</i> with irritating vocals. 'Attack On Memory' is the first album to be recorded as a full band, and as a result it sounds much...<i>fuller</i>. This may also have a little something to do with getting in <b>Steve Albini</b> to man the recording process (that guy who did <b>Pixies' 'Surfer Rosa'</b>, <i>THAT GUY WHO DID <b>NIRVANA'S 'IN UTERO</b>'</i>). Although Baldi has stated that all Alibini did during the sessions was play on Facebook, and blog about food (hmmmm?!).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hk4O1CsfrTU/TynHkzbPbNI/AAAAAAAADY8/SSEJubFtxfg/s1600/120201-cloud-nothings.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hk4O1CsfrTU/TynHkzbPbNI/AAAAAAAADY8/SSEJubFtxfg/s1600/120201-cloud-nothings.png"/></a>So, how have Cloud Nothings changed? Just listen to the opening couplet of '<b>Attack On Memory</b>' – and you'll barely recognise them. '<b>No Future / No Past</b>' is slow-burning, moody alternative-rock – not a million miles away from Pixies, with grumbling bass and eerie whining building to an exhilarating last minute in which Baldi screams “no future, no past” repeatedly. Darker, angrier, and a damn lot better than anything Baldi has written before. However, the second track '<b>Wasted Days</b>' is not just the best song of their career, it's the best alternative song of the last few months. At nearly 9 minutes, it's much longer than anything else on the album, but it never feels excessively strung-out. Starting off as a simple garage-punk number with a massive vocal hook, it soon gets stuck into a progressive, vocal-less groove, with bubbling sonic textures and climbing, post-hardcore guitars. It’s sprawling, but the climb is never without precision, and the heavy conclusion features Baldi's best ever vocal performance – barking-then-screaming “<i>I thought I would be more that this</i>” over and over with some mighty, mighty passion. It is <i>huge</i>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Too huge, in fact, as the record never really matches those impeccable heights. The simplistic, pop-punk numbers sound ten times tighter (and three times heavier) than pre-album three, with '<b>Cut You</b>' and single '<b>Stay Useless</b>' featuring Cloud Nothings' best ever pop-melodies, and '<b>Fall In</b>' and '<b>Our Plans</b>' incorporating an intelligent emo sensibility (like <i>Drive Thru's The Early November</i>, or <i>Deep Elm's</i> roster). These songs are good, great even, but one can't help wishing that Baldi had allowed the band to flesh out these tunes, in the same way they beat up 'Wasted Days' to perfection. You see, the only major gripe I have with Cloud Nothings is Baldi's voice. He basically sounds like a couple of teeny, tiny blocked nostrils, so his voice isn't particularly well suited to the melodic pop-punk that he seems intent on producing. His voice is much better suited to post-hardcore whines, barks and screams, or the groaning grunge of '<b>No Sentiment</b>' – a brooding mid-paced number with splashy drums and distorted guitar work. The most exciting track actually comes in the form of an instrumental: '<b>Separation</b>'. This ferocious punk-rock song is built around an insanely catchy, spiky guitar riff (catchier than any vocal hook on the album), and contains urgent, quick-fire drums, with snare, snare, and SNARE all over the place.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If it sounds like I found the album disappointing, then I have misled you. There is real quality to the record as a whole, with the vocals, drums and guitar parts having been considerably improved. The production is spot on, and the song structures are given enough room to breathe sufficiently, effortlessly, yet managing to retain Baldi's sense of sharpness. But just listen to '<b>Wasted Days</b>' and think to yourself: what if <b>Cloud Nothings</b> produced a whole album of 'Wasted Days''...WHAT IF!? Nonetheless, this is essential listening for fans of any sort of melodic punk (post, pop, garage, etc).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'ATTACK ON MEMORY' IS RELEASED 6TH FEBRUARY THROUGH <a href="http://shop.wichita-recordings.com/DigitalProduct.aspx?rid=379&amp;fid=12&amp;brid=5"><b>WICHITA</b></a> // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cloudnothings?sk=wall"><b>CLOUD NOTHINGS</b></a></div>||

Music Liberation's Writers takeover week : Moker|<div style="text-align: justify;">To round off the Music Liberation's Writers takeover week we have <a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/musicgob"><b>Moker</b></a>... </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cNKuCSF5ehI/Twc6dP4Lf-I/AAAAAAAADXk/9u_4neQb5eI/s1600/jm_twathat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cNKuCSF5ehI/Twc6dP4Lf-I/AAAAAAAADXk/9u_4neQb5eI/s1600/jm_twathat.jpg"/></a>"Well this is a little surprising. Looking back at the artists I’ve managed to review in 2011, the one thing that’s abundantly clear is that I’ve heavily favoured music with female vocals and shoegaze, layered guitars. This must be some kind of subconscious shift in my tastes as I’d never have normally ticked such boxes if I had to describe my favourite music. I’m pleasantly surprised. It’s a bit the reverse of when you go through your record collection and wonder why there’s so much awful metal in there. Or is that just me? (<i>ED: Nope!</i>)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, out of the all the reviews this year, my three favourite would have to be <b>Sea Oleena’s</b> beautiful new EP, the New York duo <b>Acrylics</b> single ‘<i>Molly’s Vertigo</i>’ and <b>EMA’s</b> fantastic debut album ‘<i>Past Life and Martyred Saints</i>’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If I had to rank these three in order (and I do) it would go as such:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rr5m1Yx3wGM/Twc-rQibMYI/AAAAAAAADX0/ln_byv7ouVQ/s1600/acrylics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rr5m1Yx3wGM/Twc-rQibMYI/AAAAAAAADX0/ln_byv7ouVQ/s1600/acrylics.jpg"/></a>3) <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/08/single-review-acrylics-mollys-vertigo.html"><b>Acrylics - Molly's Vertigo</b></a> : If only because it was a single review rather than a whole body of work. This dreamy 80s tinged pop song was truly fantastic.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#%21/pages/Acrylics/162211760462307"><b>Acrylics</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4DOjLls4dgA/Twc-UjdxPFI/AAAAAAAADXs/iO0exAMXghQ/s1600/ema.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4DOjLls4dgA/Twc-UjdxPFI/AAAAAAAADXs/iO0exAMXghQ/s1600/ema.jpg"/></a> </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">2) <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/07/album-review-ema-past-life-martyred.html"><b>EMA - Past Life Martyred Saints</b></a> : Already in many critics’ top ten lists, this wide-ranging and off-kilter debut is a true masterpiece. I wrote that it sounds as if she was on the verge of a breakdown and letting every emotion flow out into the music and I stand by that verbose description; perhaps because it’s a gloriously verbose record in all the right ways. Every listen will bring something new. Also album opener ‘<b>The Grey Ship</b>’ is a worthy contender for Single of 2011.  <a href="http://cameouttanowhere.com/"><b>EMA</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WrIQHw_U_b4/Twc_KptUSoI/AAAAAAAADYE/qElLmZkdFig/s1600/sea+oleena.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WrIQHw_U_b4/Twc_KptUSoI/AAAAAAAADYE/qElLmZkdFig/s1600/sea+oleena.jpg"/></a>1) <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/12/ep-review-sea-oleena-sleeplessness.html"><b>Sea Oleena - Sleeplessness</b></a> : There’s no escaping the beauty of <b>Sea Oleena’s</b> music. Both her most recent EP and her self-titled debut are an intoxicating mix of ghostly vocals and layered ambient noise. Intimate, emotive and leftfield, she’s been my favourite find of this year.  <a href="http://seaoleena.bandcamp.com/"><b>Sea Oleena</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F14693031&amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe><br/><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kjcDICle4u8/Twc_u2aV7FI/AAAAAAAADYM/lDOkvG7H9Og/s1600/372953_7722198515_977887147_q.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kjcDICle4u8/Twc_u2aV7FI/AAAAAAAADYM/lDOkvG7H9Og/s1600/372953_7722198515_977887147_q.jpg"/></a>With regards to next year, there are a few artists on my radar who are worth keeping an eye out for. The first is angular metal band <a href="http://alrightthecaptain.bandcamp.com/"><b>Alright the Captain</b></a>. Their album was released all the way back in January and despite being a perfect slab of relentless jagged noise, it didn’t get the coverage it deserved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QP41mlCFZYE/TwdBoGa40jI/AAAAAAAADYU/SWALWncyqr4/s1600/pengillys.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QP41mlCFZYE/TwdBoGa40jI/AAAAAAAADYU/SWALWncyqr4/s1600/pengillys.jpg"/></a>The second recommendation would be a band from the North of England called <a href="http://pengillys.bandcamp.com/"><b>Pengilly’s</b></a>. An unusual name for an unusual band. Their honest, heartfelt and spacious approach to music is a little like a folk band remixed by <i>James Blake</i>. The future can only be bright for these trendsetters. (<i>ED: The keen eyed amongst you will remember we featured Pengilly's on <b>Music Liberation</b> back in September with the video for '<a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-video-pengillys-tobys-hill.html"><b>Toby's Hill</b></a>'.</i>)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PNaYaGrfL_U/TwdCGDYdt-I/AAAAAAAADYc/_5EgDkyVH88/s1600/276956_8298733825_1605778136_q.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PNaYaGrfL_U/TwdCGDYdt-I/AAAAAAAADYc/_5EgDkyVH88/s1600/276956_8298733825_1605778136_q.jpg"/></a>The final recommendation would be the well established and long running Belgium electro band <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/GOOSE/8298733825"><b>Goose</b></a>. Some might know of them but I’ve listed them here as they’ve always been at the peripheries of the funky house scene, dominated by French acts such as <i>Daft Punk</i> and <i>Justice</i>. They most recent album, released last year was superb and surely the high profile coverage they deserve should come to them off the back of their fantastic efforts.</div>||

I promised that after burning myself out in 2010 attending endless gigs, squandering (the majority of my) funds on an unnecessary eight festivals, clogging up my accommodation with Cd's that were only used once (to upload to my iPod), and destroying my Mac with an addiction to downloading new music, that I would take it a little easier - music-wise - in 2011. Do you know what I told myself on New Year's Day, 2012? I promised myself that since 2011's equally relentless musical year not only burnt me out, but actually gave me tinnitus, I <b>WILL</b> take it a little easier in 2012…</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had some huge records last year: <i>Metronomy</i>, <i>Machine Head</i>, <i>SBTRKT</i>, <i>James Blake</i>, <i>Bon Iver</i>, letlive., <i>Jamie Woon</i>, <i>Radiohead</i>, <i>Mazes</i>, <i>Gil Scott Heron &amp; Jamie XX</i>, <i>City and Colour</i>, <i>Mastodon</i>, etc. However, some of the most enjoyable music I have encountered this year has been from the underground, in the form of independent albums or debut EPs and whatnot.<br/><br/>Here is my TOP 3 from the releases I've covered for <b>Music Liberation</b> in 2011:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UnR040isJrg/TwXHJP8g_-I/AAAAAAAADWA/tzgrmtcFSaE/s1600/qd.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UnR040isJrg/TwXHJP8g_-I/AAAAAAAADWA/tzgrmtcFSaE/s1600/qd.jpg"/></a> 1. <a href="http://musicliberation.blogspot.com/2011/06/ep-review-quick-and-dead-for-rhythm.html"><b>Quick and The Dead - 'For The Rhythm'</b></a> - This little, pop punk-tinged emo EP came armed with a surprisingly full production, and some massive, massive vocal hooks. The epic title track rivals anything <i>Taking Back Sunday</i>, <i>Funeral For A Friend</i>, <i>Kids In Glass Houses</i> etc. have done.

Having only formed last year, they released a dreamy little demo called '<b>No Feel</b>' (after only having been together a month!), which was picked up by the blogosphere with all it's heart. I mean, this replication of shoegazing-tinted, noise-rock, alternative bands like <i>My Bloody Valentine</i> and <i>Sonic Youth</i> was addictive in its authenticity - the word 'nostalgic' didn't even come to mind. Little is known about the band (as they have pretty much no online presence), but i'm sure we'll be hearing more from them in 2012.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/drivetheband"><b>Drive</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NJiTOCpEIVs/TwXKfD_EmjI/AAAAAAAADWw/oIwtCuE42FQ/s1600/373102_95107627835_494219528_q.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NJiTOCpEIVs/TwXKfD_EmjI/AAAAAAAADWw/oIwtCuE42FQ/s1600/373102_95107627835_494219528_q.jpg"/></a>2. <u><b>Blue Daisy</b></u> - The London producer's recently released, debut album '<b>The Sunday Gift</b>' has received critical acclaim, but it's one of those slow-burners - electronica fans are only just starting to really pick up on the moody dubstep-laced triphop, and it's 2012 that is going to see his name truly made.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Bluedaisyofficial"><b>Blue Daisy</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bGwMYJX5sqc/TwXM03wdwJI/AAAAAAAADXI/I62pn3tW7_w/s1600/373125_24200315632_1784123955_q.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bGwMYJX5sqc/TwXM03wdwJI/AAAAAAAADXI/I62pn3tW7_w/s1600/373125_24200315632_1784123955_q.jpg"/></a>3. <u><b>Casitas</b></u> - The quirky indie-party-pop band from Devon have been quiet since releasing their independent, self-titled debut, and winning a plethora of 'battle of the bands' comps.

Whatever genre you want to classify this band under (deathcore/hardcore would be most appropriate), this is a group who I just can’t take my eye off.  The band has recently released the single '<b>Devil’s Island</b>' whilst on tour in the UK, which shows signs of new music for 2012.  This band is heart thumping rage at its best and something that they exuberate when performing live.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/architectsuk"><b>Architects</b></a></div>||

EP Review : Likes Lions - Future Colour|<div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Likes Lions</b> are an alternative rock quintet from Sheffield, UK. They are not the indie band <i>In Like Lions</i>, nor are they the electro-pop band <i>Live Like Lions</i>. And they are certainly not the hardcore punk band <i>Like Lions</i> from New York. Ever heard of SEO boys?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This <b>Likes Lions</b> formed in 2009, and '<b>Future Colour</b>' - released in October 2011 - is their debut EP. They take the more accessible aspects of math-rock and post-rock, and fuse them together to produce a heavier, Foals-esque, indie sound. For some reason (perhaps due to the massive success of the aforementioned <i>Foals</i>), I have ended up reviewing a few too many math-indie-rock EPs this year. However, Likes Lions melody-conscious take on the genre made this a somewhat enjoyable experience for me.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Author, Dreamweaver, Visionary</b>' is a fantastic choice to open the EP - with a captivating 40 seconds of prog-rock synth and guitar noodlings building up momentum to the crashing punk-rock drums and spiky alt-rock riffs that make up the bulk of the track. It's an energetic introduction to the band, with some fine instrumentation, but lacks the vocal hooks of the rest of the EP. '<b>All on Red</b>' is a mid-paced song, with softer guitar lines and a ballad-like vocal delivery. Although it may sound a little emo for some, it's the first time we are able to hear just how strong <b>Rich Bristow's</b> vocals are - his soulful delivery isn't common place for math-rock singers (who normally like to yelp - sometimes incomprehensibly).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'<b>Welcome to Seaworld</b>' sounds the closest to what Foals produce - with a dancey drumbeat and layers of atmospheric guitar lines overshadowing a simple indie riff. Their most immediate song is '<b>Futures</b>', which contains a pop-punk sensibility built up around a massive chorus - very, very memorable. Closer '<b>Badminton</b>' contains the most irregular time-signature, with a math-drum line propelling inventive dual guitar-work and soaring vocal melodies - all backed by some understated violin and cello. Just when you think the song has drawn to a quiet conclusion, up jumps an up-tempo, <i>Biffy Clyro</i>-esque stabbing riff, in unison with stabbing strings. A thrilling end to the EP.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The reason I find <b>Likes Lions</b> so appealing is because they don't try to shove the irregularity of their riffs, beats and structures down your throat - like a lot of alternative math-rock bands (I think it makes them feel progressive). Instead, they use their experimental instrumentation as a unique backdrop to the kinds of pop-rock hooks that can stay with you for the rest of the day. Can't wait to see what they'll come up with next. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For fans of <i>Tellison</i> (and, of course,<i> Foals</i>).  <a href="http://likeslions.bandcamp.com/"><b>Download 'Future Colour' EP</b></a> // <a href="http://www.facebook.com/likeslions"><b>Likes Lions</b></a></div>||
EP Review : FaltyDL - Atlantis|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HyFkJnb8gY0/Tu9ES-M7-vI/AAAAAAAADNM/ij2lnk0QXTY/s1600/5021392691190.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HyFkJnb8gY0/Tu9ES-M7-vI/AAAAAAAADNM/ij2lnk0QXTY/s320/5021392691190.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>Released earlier last month, '<b>Atlantis</b>' is the new EP from <b>FaltyDL</b>. Known to his friends as <b>Drew Lustman</b>, FaltyDL has steadily been making a name for himself stateside as '<i>one of the hottest names in electronic music</i>'. He has an impressive work rate, putting out two albums, an EP, and three singles all since 2008. Now the New York based artist is ready to release another in the shape of this four-track EP, which is his first record for <b>Ninja Tune</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">'Atlantis' is an album which pays homage to Lustman's musical knowledge and history, as well as demonstrating his ears desire to take his sounds to a new level. The title track has an almost inaudibly low bass droning throughout as a rhythmic beat commands you to move. Whilst obvious comparisons can be drawn with <i>Fourtet</i> on the opening track, FaltyDL opens things up on '<b>Can't Stop The Prophet</b>', as the pace is slowed right down and a weird synth and strings combination proceeds to put you into a dream like state, before it all goes drum and bassy near the end. '<b>My Light, My Love</b>' carries on in similar vain, with chilled but off kilter beats seemingly lulling you into a strange vortex where you can't escape. Final track '<b>The Sale Ends</b>' is a more conventional minimal track, perfect for that 4am vibe. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Whilst his high productivity may lead to some questioning the continued quality of his work, FaltyDL shows that variation is the key here. This four track record shows that he has plenty of interesting ideas floating around his head, and to put a marker on that creativity would be disastrous for both him and us.<br/><br/><b>Atlantis</b> is out now through <a href="http://ninjatune.net/release/faltydl/atlantis-ep"><b>Ninja Tune</b></a> // <a href="http://faltydl.tumblr.com/"><b>FaltyDL</b></a></div>||
EP Review : Sea Oleena - Sleeplessness|<div style="text-align: justify;">Standing at seven tracks in length, <b>Sea Oleena’s</b> new release '<b>Sleeplessness</b>' could be considered more mini-album than EP, but that still wouldn’t justify the enormity of the music recorded by Montréal multi-instrumentalist<b> Charlotte Loseth</b>. The record is a beautiful warm blanket of songs, each one an epic cacophony of layered sounds, reverb and haunting female vocals delivered with the unassuming charm of a girl humming a song in her bedroom.<br/><br/>Each hushed swirl of a song bleeds into the next, joined together by the rumbling and eerie ambient sounds throughout. For what on first listen could be dismissed as the twee ramblings of yet another coy female artist, scratch the surface of Loseth’s musical landscape and it’s like walking into Narnia. There’s wonder at every turn.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Vocals sounding like mere ethereal whispers hide beautiful poetry: “<i>Invisible physicians, lawyers, and magicians / an instant of existence at the table in the kitchen</i>” she wails as the opening lines of this record. “<i>This is what he wrote in the ripped-up note: / I've become something even less than a ghost. / Even more of a though, I've become a mirage. / I'm the shaky air encircling the flickering flame. / I'm the white wall swallowing the window frame. hall</i>” she hisses over ‘<b>Insomnia Plague</b>’.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Instrumentation is orthodox but they’re whipped into yearning swirls of something more exquisite. Plucked acoustic guitars, pianos and echoy bass drums lay the foundations for Loseth’s, numerous but never overdone multiple vocal lines.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps if criticism could be levelled it’s that there are no standout tracks to be found on this record; no big choruses or sing along lyrics, just a body of delicate spacey folk that’s presented as a single entity. This of course is the point.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The magical world of Sleeplessness is intoxicating. It feels like Loseth creates such music for the purpose of sharing with the listener something greater than herself. This organic and ever shifting waterfall of a record demands and deserves our attention.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All songs and lyrics are available on the <a href="http://seaoleena.bandcamp.com/album/sea-oleena"><b>Sea Oleena bandcamp</b></a> page, whilst the cassette version of this album (including her first self titled EP) can be purchased via <a href="http://www.bridgetownrecords.info/"><b>Bridgetown Records</b></a>. // <a href="http://seaoleena.bandcamp.com/"><b>Sea Oleena</b></a></div>||
EP Review : Alphabet Backwards - British Explorer|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uDvFIweTIwE/Tud_wqL71kI/AAAAAAAADMw/tp7lXRk3pYo/s1600/1791726098-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uDvFIweTIwE/Tud_wqL71kI/AAAAAAAADMw/tp7lXRk3pYo/s320/1791726098-1.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>Recently released through <i>Highline Records</i>, '<b>British Explorer</b>' is a new three track EP from Oxford's <b>Alphabet Backwards</b>. With apparent support from the likes of <i>Huw Stephens</i>, <i>Tom Robinson</i>, and <i>Steve Lamacq</i>, the band have been making steady inroads during 2011, with their simple mission statement being to '<i>champion the noble art of pop music, dancing all the way</i>'. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Opening track '<b>Big Top</b>' brings up a clear comparison with Cardiff's <i>Los Campesinos!</i> with the dual combination of male and female vocals being a striking one, however some clever synths help to widen the gap between the bands' style, and Alphabet Backwards ear for a catchy melody is hard to ignore. '<b>Tonight</b>' carries on in a similar vein, with an interesting mix up of acoustic guitars put against the synths, as well as a clear appreciation of space within the song, which helps to broaden the bands' appeal. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The final track of this short record is '<b>Taller</b>', which is also the leading single to be taken from it. An obvious choice too after hearing the opening few bars, as some frankly irresistible vocals from frontman <i>James Hitchman</i> are played out over yet more guitar/synth based pop music. I think what helps make <b>Alphabet Backwards</b> stand out over their pop loving piers is that they do keep things simple, not being afraid to let their music and lyrics stand up for themselves, as opposed to other acts who throw everything into it hoping something will stick.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The 'British Explorer' EP is <a href="http://alphabackwards.bandcamp.com/"><b>available now</b></a> through <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Highline-Records/161884757209312"><b>Highline Records</b></a> // <a href="http://www.alphabetbackwards.net/"><b>Alphabet Backwards</b></a></div>||
EP Review : Daughter - The Wild Youth|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jc2FxsxQDSI/TuIXd1gD-WI/AAAAAAAADMo/DRmsvcgAqVE/s1600/509061585-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jc2FxsxQDSI/TuIXd1gD-WI/AAAAAAAADMo/DRmsvcgAqVE/s320/509061585-1.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Daughter</b> are <i>Elena Tonra</i> and <i>Igor Haefeli</i>, a double act that have swept through 2011 with numerous gigs across the UK, put out an EP titled '<b>His Young Heart</b>', and they end the year with another record, '<b>The Wild Youth</b>', which is out through <b>Communion Records</b>.<br/><br/>Personally I first discovered Daughter whilst they were supporting <i>Benjamin Francis Leftwich</i> during his Autumn tour, catching their intimate and spell-bounding show at the Union Chapel in Islington, where their exquisite performance equalled if not better that of the headliner.<br/><br/>'<b>The Wild Youth</b>' begins with '<b>Home</b>', a track which showcases what makes Daughter so utterly brilliant. Elena and Igor have an ear to create space within their music, moments where their instruments can breath and the listener can fully appreciate the beauty that is being played out before them. The poignant combination of Elena's lingering vocals and the delicate acoustic/electric guitars demonstrate how simplicity in music is something to be applauded.<br/><br/>'<b>Medicine</b>' is built upon simple piano chords, with the focus put upon the beautiful words and vocals, as is '<b>Love</b>', with Elena's mystical vocals driving the song along as drums and guitars slowly build to a gentle crescendo. My favourite track on the record is '<b>Youth</b>', with the thought provoking lyrics having the perfect backdrop of drawn-out music to stand out and be counted.<br/><br/>It's testament to Daughter's belief and confidence in their own ideas that they give their music almost a license to bask and shine in its simplicity, and how grateful we must be for that. Music Liberation eagerly awaits a full length release in 2012...<br/><br/><a href="http://ohdaughter.bandcamp.com/album/the-wild-youth-ep"><b>You can buy 'The Wild Youth' EP now</b></a> // <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ohdaughter"><b>Daughter</b></a> // <a href="http://www.communionmusic.co.uk/"><b>Communion Records</b></a> </div>||

Album Review : Hectic Zeniths - Hectic Zeniths|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sdBq5rHEplQ/TtUyP324sEI/AAAAAAAADLc/DV2uRtc_PS4/s1600/2243870907-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sdBq5rHEplQ/TtUyP324sEI/AAAAAAAADLc/DV2uRtc_PS4/s320/2243870907-1.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><b>Hectic Zeniths’</b> self titled debut is the work of Brooklyn, NY native and current Philadelphia resident <b>Adam Morgan Prince</b>. His moniker is an anagram of <i>Zeitschtichen</i>, a German word meaning shifts in, or layers of time. This is an apt name for both the artist and the album, as each track is a richly layered, brooding soundscape.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who frequents <a href="http://qn5.com/discuss/"><i>QN5 Music’s forum</i></a> will already be aware of what happens when Prince gets hold of a piano. Under the moniker ‘<i>amplifya</i>’, his take on <i>CunninLynguists</i>’ ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHwDG_fnY"><b><i>The Light</i></b></a>’ from the <i>QN5 Rmx Vol. 2 EP</i> (2006) was well received, whilst he also showcased his chops in a cover of ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJao0YQjEIE&amp;feature=player_embedded"><b><i>Gathered</i></b></a>’ from <i>Tonedeff’s Archetype</i> (2005).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">His album follows a loose formula and is successful for it. Most of the tracks are built around a melancholy piano section and either live or sampled drums. Added to this are vocal samples that work like added instrumentation, violins and a couple of tracks featuring guitar (‘<b>Why Shoot Debris About It</b>’ and ‘<b>Zeitschtichen</b>’), making a dark and sombre LP that is perfect for bumping in your headphones on a cold winter morning.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The intro, ‘<b>One That Got Away</b>’ sets the mood well, with reversed strings, a mournful vocal sample and playful beat, before segueing into the first piano led track, ‘<b>Then and Now</b>’. The album goes from strength to strength from there. ‘<b>I Might Drown</b>’, a standout among an album full of strong cuts, features an upbeat drum pattern that contrasts the subtle keys, haunting vocals that drift eerily in and out of the song and the dramatic bursts of violin. The subtle guitar in ‘<b>Zeitschtichen</b>’ compliments the piano and plodding beat well and an airy vocal weaving through the piece wraps things up nicely.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While never reaching their cinematic heights, <b>Hectic Zeniths</b> draws comparisons with <i>Blue Sky Black Death</i> or <i>Emancipator</i>, each known for creating rich and densely layered music. At eleven tracks long and clocking in at half an hour from beginning to end, some may feel it may be on the short side, but with each song containing so many elements, replay value will undoubtedly be high.<br/><br/>Hectic Zeniths will be released 10th January 2012, you can<b> </b><a href="http://hecticzeniths.bandcamp.com/"><b>stream or pre-order the album now</b></a><br/></div>||
New Music : Rosa Valle / Therapist / Smother Party|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Rosa Valle</u></b></div><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Rosa Valle</u></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Uncompromising math rock four-piece from Middlesborough, <b>Rosa Valle</b> recently released their debut EP titled '<b>Holy Bermuda</b>', through a split between <b>Holy Roar Records</b> and <b>Big Scary Monsters</b>. Sounding like a cross between Rolo<i> Tomassi</i> at their heaviest, <i>Foals</i> at their gentlest, and <i>The Murder of Rosa Luxemburg</i> at their craziest, this EP demonstrates a band with a clear belief in their ideas and a band who possess an inherent desire to express themselves in whatever way they see fit. I'm expecting big things from these chaps when it comes to the recording of their debut LP. *Recommended track - '<b>Mathemagician</b>'.*</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Stream the record on <a href="http://rosavalle.bandcamp.com/"><b>bandcamp</b></a>.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/rosavallemusic"><b>Rosa Valle</b></a>  <a href="http://holyroarrecords.com/"><b>Holy Roar Records</b></a>  <a href="http://www.bsmrocks.com/"><b>Big Scary Monsters</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Bursting out of Phoenix CA come <b>Therapist</b>, a bouncy electro punk act who first came to our attention with the track '<b>I Know What I Want</b>'. Released through <b>Indian Gold Records</b>, that song was very much reminiscent of the likes of  <i>Teenagersintokyo</i>, <i>Chaingang</i>, and <i>Operator Please</i>, with the stop start jerky combo of the vocals and the bands stripped back electro punk working to great effect. This week the band releases their debut EP, titled '<b>Hearts Beats</b>', featuring more of the same bass heavy electro punk vibes. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Grab a <a href="http://wearetherapist.bandcamp.com/"><b>download/stream</b></a> now.  <a href="http://wearetherapist.blogspot.com/"><b>Therapist</b></a>  <a href="http://indiangoldrecords.blogspot.com/"><b>Indian Gold Records</b></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><u><b>Smother Party</b></u></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Based out of Brooklyn, <b>Smother Party</b> are a groove laden instrumental rock three-piece who earlier this year released their debut album, '<b>Casa Limon</b>'. Whilst being a challenging album it will reward those who stick with it, as repeated plays open up a whole new world of what can be acheived with two guitars and a drum kit. In parts bewildering, in parts brilliant, 'Casa Limon' showcases a band with abstract ideas above the 'normal' rockers station. Particularly of note is the sound of the guitars on this album, which almost sound out of tune at times but are still somehow hugely rhythmic and head nod-able, like '<a href="http://smotherparty.bandcamp.com/track/serious-beef"><b>Serious Beef</b></a>'.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Stream/Download on <a href="http://smotherparty.bandcamp.com/"><b>bandcamp</b></a>  <a href="http://variantrecords.com/index.html"><b>Variant Records</b></a>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Smother-Party/106362182748082?sk=wall"><b>Smother Party</b></a></div>||

We also enthused about the '<i>beautifully crafted cinematic experience</i>' that accompanied the song, a pattern which has been repeated with each track that has been taken from The Bullitts debut LP '<b>They'll Die By Dawn And Other Short Stories</b>'. Well now thanks to a new six part music documentary being put together by <a href="http://www.redbullstudios.com/"><b><i>Red Bull Studios</i></b></a> and <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk"><b><i>Vice Media</i></b></a> titled '<a href="http://www.vice.com/the-producers"><b>The Producers</b></a>', you can now meet the man behind <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thebullitts"><b>The Bullitts</b></a>, the enthralling <b>Jeymes Samuel</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In episode 2 of the ongoing series, Jeymes talks about everything connected with his love for music and films, as well as behind the scenes footage of him working with <i>Syience</i> on a short film project score. It's really quite inspiring stuff, and shows a man with a genuine interest for making art, with a clear intent on truly making a mark on those around him.</div>||
Album Review : Evidence - Cats & Dogs|<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TDn-5iXqrF0/TsqJrVtvrJI/AAAAAAAADKk/SeI1dQ78h4o/s1600/Evidence-Cats-Dogs-Artwork.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TDn-5iXqrF0/TsqJrVtvrJI/AAAAAAAADKk/SeI1dQ78h4o/s320/Evidence-Cats-Dogs-Artwork.jpg" width="320"/></a></div>As is often the case with artists that earn critical acclaim, ‘backpackers’ favourite, LA’s <a href="http://www.dilatedpeoples.com/"><b>Dilated Peoples</b></a> never seemed to be able to turn that praise into the commercial success they deserve. With four albums under their belts, <b>DJ Babu</b>, <b>Rakaa Iriscience</b> and <b>Evidence</b> decided to take a break from recording as a group and focus on their solo careers. Of the group’s two lyricists, it is <b>Evidence</b> that has successfully managed to maintain something of a cult following in an increasingly crowded hip hop market.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following the meteorology theme Ev started on his well-received debut LP<b> 'The Weatherman</b>' in 2007, <b>Cats &amp; Dogs</b> is his first release for Minneapolis based <b>Rhymesayers Entertainment</b>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While Evidence may not be the most technically gifted emcee, his voice is engaging, his flow polished and on every track he oozes a laidback confidence that fans of West Coast Hip Hop will be familiar with.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">What does need to highlighted, though, is Ev’s ear for beats. Simply put, it is impeccable. While he is himself an accomplished producer, only two tracks on the album ('<b>I Don’t Need Love</b>' and '<b>Late For The Sky</b>') boast his name in the liner notes, even then only with co-production credits. Instead he hands production duties to long-time friend and collaborator <b>The Alchemist</b>, duo <b>Sid Roams</b>, <b>Rahki</b>, <b>Charli Brown</b> and <b>Twiz the Beat King</b>, the lesser-known names more than holding their own in esteemed company as the album shifts from soulful and introspective to big and brash seamlessly.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mwCBQUF7HHk/TsqJ8ud5cTI/AAAAAAAADKs/99Tjn5a5CBs/s1600/evidence-300x225.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-mwCBQUF7HHk/TsqJ8ud5cTI/AAAAAAAADKs/99Tjn5a5CBs/s1600/evidence-300x225.jpg"/></a></div><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The album also features the legendary <b>DJ Premier</b> who laces the understated single '<i><b>You</b></i>' and the darker, horn-based album closer '<i><b>Epilogue</b></i>' with his trademark chopped samples and scratched hooks, to the delight of this fan-boy, at least.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The featured guests are also strong. <b>Aloe Blacc</b> drops in to add some soul to the sinister opener '<b><i>The Liner Notes</i>'</b> and '<i><b>The Red Carpet</b></i>' sees Evidence hold his own with two of Rap’s most celebrated lyricists; <b>Raekwon</b> (of <i>Wu-Tang Clan</i>) and West Coast veteran, <b>Ras Kass</b> over a smooth vocal-sample based Alchemist backdrop. Label mates <b>Slug</b> and <b>Aesop Rock</b> turn up on Emo-Rap fans’ wet-dream '<i><b>Late To The Sky</b></i>' and underground Rap’s current golden boy (and deservedly so) <b>Roc Marciano</b> blesses the moody strings and guitar lick of '<b>Fame</b>' alongside Mobb Deep’s Prodigy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: justify;">With no trace of a radio-friendly single or a floor-filling club banger, <b>Cats &amp; Dogs</b> may not win <b>Evidence</b> new fans, but after two decades in the business, it is clear that isn’t important to him. He knows his strengths and he plays to them.<br/><br/>If you like whiplash-inducing beats and solid rhymes, you won’t go wrong with this LP.<br/><br/>You can buy the album now from <a href="http://rhymesayers.com/"><b>Rhymesayers Entertainment</b></a> // <a href="https://www.facebook.com/misterevidence"><b>Evidence</b></a><br/><br/><b>[*</b>Many thanks to <b>Tom Nash</b> for his first article for <b>Music Liberation</b>, find out more about Tom on his <a href="http://blog.thewritetomnash.co.uk/"><b>The Write Tom Nash</b></a> site.<b>*]</b></div>||
