          <p>Whatever you say, man, but may be the others would agree with me&#8230;<br />
Boxing is not all about standing there toe to toe, its about skills and abilities, whatever it takes&#8230; If someone has never lost for straight 17 years and millions are still willing to pay big bucks to watch his fights, then your point is useless&#8230;<br />
Of course there are haters, who pay to watch him lose, but they are not in great number&#8230;</p>

          <p>Good list&#8230; But all this negative talk about how Mexican boxers shouldn&#8217;t be up on the top 5 is funny as shizz. Even though Mexico is ONLY second to USA for total world champions&#8230; past and present! And let me add that many American world champions are Mexican-American. That kinda evens out both countries out doesn&#8217;t it? Take a seat haters, Y&#8217;all lame. And I&#8217;m not even Mexican&#8230; I just respect their warrior mentality in the ring!</p>

          <p>Lomachenko is 25, &amp; potentially a great fighter but still remains to be seen how he will be managed, his pro debut is due to be a 10 rounder against a seasoned pro who is 23-4 so I just hope they don&#8217;t move him too quickly.</p>
<p>Think Arum is trying to move Lomachenko &amp; Zou Shiming along like Rigondeux &amp; get them in line for world titles early on (10+ fights).</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t take GGG serious because he now calling Mayweather and Canelo both smaller weight champs. Until he picks on someone his own size i.e. Ward or Kid Chocolate then GGG is a hype job. He offer to move down 6 lbs rather than move up 8 lbs making for an easier training camp.</p>

          <p>I cam uderstand some people&#8217;s reservations on believing GGG&#8217;s hype but believe me Macklin is a top level contender who should of been givin the decision V sturm and gave Marinez a great fight over 12. Golovkin demolished him, and the lack of top level names on his record is because he&#8217;s so avoided, he was Geal&#8217;s mandatory for the WBA and he vacated a world title just to avoid him. This boy is special and professional.</p>

          <p>WOW! I can&#8217;t believe a bunch of you dummies are commenting negatively about a guys personal list. He asked you to face reality and some of you can&#8217;t do that. Truth is he&#8217;s right on a lot of points. The key word I picked up on is &#8220;IF PROMOTED PROPERLY&#8221;. Garcia was out on his feet. when the ref ask him to step to him to put in his mouth piece he just stood there for a sec. Garcia even mention it during the post fight. Cruz is moving up fast. Spence is still a work in progress who couldn&#8217;t get pass a weak Olympic field. Alvarez does have a built in excuse for Mayweather loss. Broner isn&#8217;t discipline even to be #1 p4p because of weight outside of boxing.His idol Floyd even said he has a lot to work on after the Paulie fight. Tom Drury why don&#8217;t you write something original and stop copying other guys styles just to get hits on your articles. And lastly GGG is not under 25 years old.</p>

          <h3>          Pugilistic_Professor </h3>
          <p>I hate to say it, but if the criteria is under 25, Tyson Fury has to be noted. Not because of his current skill, but because3 he has made a lot of noise in this sport and he&#8217;s basically an infant in the HW division where we routinely see fighters fight into their 40s. Thats 18 more years of Tyson. Not that I personally look forward to it, but he will be a face in the sport for many years to come. And nobody got the shaft on this list like Adrien Broner who, whether you like it or not is already a two weight champion and will, through his ridiculous antics, continue to garner a bunch of lime light. While I personally cant stand either of them, they should not have been omitted from this list.</p>

          <p>Mayweather will never die, he will be champion forever. No one is fast enough to chase him down and hit him. His reflexes and speed will never slow down. Notice how he knocks out every one he fights and if not he leaves them a bloody mess, oh wait he never knocks any one out or leaves them a bloody mess. Hmmm&#8230;..oh I forgot, running is boxing&#8230;</p>

          <h3>          Mark </h3>
          <p>Callum Smith, Luke Campbell, and Chris Eubank jr  i think will really get noticed in 2014, all these men are young and are recognisable names around the ordinary boxing fan in the UK, Callum has exceptional physical qualities as well as sound technical ability, he&#8217;s got incredible speed and power and pin point accuracy, along with his incredible professional attitude he will be a great IMO. We&#8217;ve not seen much of Luke in the pro game but in his debut he looked like a monster the timing and speed he showed almost mirrored Floyd in his classy debut. I think up to now people ( me included ) have been writing off Chris as just a hype job because he has the name of his father, but after he stopped the extremely durable ribchev ( who gave rose a tough twelve rounds ) My opinion has changed complete.y he had a sharp jab and showed quick and snappy power, I see these three and more becoming much bigger names in 2014, I don&#8217;t see them challenging at world level till at least 2015 or 16, maybe with the exemption of Callum Smith in maybe December next year.</p>

          <p>If anyone wants to know what&#8217;s wrong with boxing, this article is the problem in words. This has to be the weakest list of all time! Mikey Garcia has moved to the safty of the super featherweight division were he is safely away from Russell Jr and Rigonedaux, on the bottom and Garcia ,Marquez, Peterson, Matthyssee, Judah and Peterson on the top. Lara would KO Alvarez in 8 rounds. Ward would crush Groves. Santa Cruz&#8217;s straight ahead style may be pleasing to Mexican fans but it will not help him against Regondeaux or Russell Jr. Writer you are dreaming! WAke up!</p>

          <p>Silly articfle.  Garcia was never out on his feet. Mayweather has no need to go toe-to-toe with Canelo.  That would be stupid on his part.  Where is Broner on that list?  What about Spence or Crawford.  Garcia and LSC are keepers.  The jury is out on Canelo. He was pretty dejected after the fight, and time will tell if he can get over the loss.  Groves should not be on that list, and it&#8217;s a slap in the face to suggest that he&#8217;s better than Froch.</p>

          <p>Groves barely beat DeGale and Anderson and he ran a mile from a rematch with the latter. yet he&#8217;ll &#8216;take care of business&#8217; against Froch, a man at least 5 levels above either DeGale or Anderson? Complete joke.</p>

          <p>Canelo toe-to-toe. LMFAO. Is Saul another PEDcquiao who needs to be matched against body bags? If Canelo is so tough, why not fight guys bigger than him like Floyd did? Let&#8217;s see Canelo go toe to toe with GGG, Quillen &#8230; and prove he has the balls of Mayweather to fight bigger guys.</p>

          <p>Broner who is a n a$$ should in, or top of this list. If he sticks at it he could make lww Champ and clean up at 140 llbs. Strange guy though.</p>
<p>Scott Quigg, the next big British thing, does everything well and most things better. His inevitable clash with Frampton, could well be for both there world straps. Such a shame that G Rinkydinkydoo ( Cuban super bantom God) Is in his weight class.</p>
<p>George Groves looks world class but has it all too prove, Froch should have too much for him.</p>
