                                                    <meta property="og:description" content="My previous rantings on this blog probably don&#8217;t signal it, but my sport of choice (as an observer, not a participant) is boxing. As any boxing fan knows, or any casual observer knows, the man to watch is Floyd &#8220;Money&#8221; Mayweather Jr., the highest paid athlete in the world, who as of last Saturday is toting a record 45-0, the second longest undefeated streak of all time in the sport (behind only heavyweight Joe Calzaghe&#8217;s 46-0 record that he retired on).


 So, with Mayweather&#8217;s defeat of Canelo Alvarez on the 14th, the question begs: Is it at all possible to defeat Floyd Mayweather?


 In theory, yes it is. The working theory on cracking the code (or puzzle as boxing analysts like to say) is a simple one: Based on how defensively he fights, and his physical size, Mayweather isn&#8217;t the type to take a punch well, especially to the facial region. So in theory, a powerful right hook to the jaw would be all it takes to defeat him.


 However, to compensate for this fact, Mayweather has the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog on crystal meth, and a seemingly collapsable skeleton not unlike a rat, thus turning him into some kind of water monster in the ring. Now, there have been admirable attempts, and both Canelo Alvarez and Oscar de la Hoya had great ideas going in.


 Alvarez was certainly prepared mentally going in to the fight. He recognized that he was the heavier hitter, and he recognized that part of Mayweather&#8217;s strategy is psychological. Eventually the desire to hit him will become one of desperation, you will get sloppy, and Mayweather will dominate the entire fight. Problem with Alvarez was that he wasn&#8217;t physically prepared for the match, as was proven that night by the split decision (I would like to say unanimous but C.J. Ross was apparently on some kind of drug because she called the fight dead even).


 De La Hoya had an idea that had a heavier chance of success, and certainly gave Mayweather a run for his money (no pun intended). He chased Floyd down like a bloodhound, hoping to corner him and smash him into kingdom come. This was where Floyd Mayweather&#8217;s amazing dodging ability was proven to be nigh-perfect, because even when cornered he slipped away and dodged the punches that de la Hoya was throwing around. However, discussing whether or not these strategies work is irrelevant now. They&#8217;ve both failed.


 So the question being: Who is left for the champion? There is the obvious choice of Adrien Broner (38-0), the champ&#8217;s &#8220;Mini-Me&#8221; but he&#8217;s stated time and time again that he has no desire to fight his &#8220;big brother&#8221;. So he&#8217;s out. Another opponent that has been discussed fluently is Manny Pacquiao, but I don&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;s on Mayweather&#8217;s radar anymore with his subsequent, back-to-back losses against both Tim Bradley (30-0) and Juan Manuel Marquez (50-6), who are set to fight on HBO. So the victor of that fight could go on to fight Floyd Mayweather on Showtime.


 So I ask anyone else who knows about the sport, who is left to fight the Pound-for-Pound King, Floyd &#8220;Money&#8221; Mayweather?"/>

<p>However, to compensate for this fact, Mayweather has the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog on crystal meth, and a seemingly collapsable skeleton not unlike a rat, thus turning him into some kind of water monster in the ring. Now, there have been admirable attempts, and both Canelo Alvarez and Oscar de la Hoya had great ideas going in.</p>
<p>Alvarez was certainly prepared mentally going in to the fight. He recognized that he was the heavier hitter, and he recognized that part of Mayweather&#8217;s strategy is psychological. Eventually the desire to hit him will become one of desperation, you will get sloppy, and Mayweather will dominate the entire fight. Problem with Alvarez was that he wasn&#8217;t physically prepared for the match, as was proven that night by the split decision (I would like to say unanimous but C.J. Ross was apparently on some kind of drug because she called the fight dead even).</p>
<p>De La Hoya had an idea that had a heavier chance of success, and certainly gave Mayweather a run for his money (no pun intended). He chased Floyd down like a bloodhound, hoping to corner him and smash him into kingdom come. This was where Floyd Mayweather&#8217;s amazing dodging ability was proven to be nigh-perfect, because even when cornered he slipped away and dodged the punches that de la Hoya was throwing around. <span>However, discussing whether or not these strategies work is irrelevant now. They&#8217;ve both failed.</span></p>
<p><span>So the question being: Who is left for the champion? There is the obvious choice of Adrien Broner (38-0), the champ&#8217;s &#8220;Mini-Me&#8221; but he&#8217;s stated time and time again that he has no desire to fight his &#8220;big brother&#8221;. So he&#8217;s out. Another opponent that has been discussed fluently is Manny Pacquiao, but I don&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;s on Mayweather&#8217;s radar anymore with his subsequent, back-to-back losses against both Tim Bradley (30-0) and Juan Manuel Marquez (50-6), who are set to fight on HBO. So the victor of that fight could go on to fight Floyd Mayweather on Showtime.</span></p>
<p><span>So I ask anyone else who knows about the sport, who is left to fight the Pound-for-Pound King, Floyd &#8220;Money&#8221; Mayweather?</span></p><p class="answer_form_container"><iframe
