Q1. Download the 1000 URIs from assignment 2...remove formatting \\
Large collection of files included in modified/ directory
\\*

Q2. Choose a query term...to ten documents...compute TFIDF values for the term
in each of the 10 documents. \\
\verbatiminput{q2/results}%
\\*

Q3. Now rank the same 10 URIs from question 2, but this time by their
PageRank. \\
\verbatiminput{q3/results}%
Briefly compare and contrast the rankings produced in questions 2
and 3.

A3: Top TFIDF was floydmayweather.com, second was themoneyteam.com. These two
were also the only two non-zero scoring options, and I infer TFIDF was heavily
weighted in the pagerank calculation. It is unfortunate the other pages weren't
page ranked, but I predict they would have linearly small results.
